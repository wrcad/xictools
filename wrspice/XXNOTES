1.   set x = "$list"
This now works to set x to the text string of the list.  Previously, the
double quotes did not accomplish this.

    set x = $list
This will set x to the first list value (as before),  To set x as
a copy of the list, use
    set x = ( $list )

2.  One can now convert a variable containing a list string to a real
list with
    set lv = ( $stringvar )
The stringvar is a string variable with a string in the form
    "( num num ... num )"

3.  Note that the displayed numbers of a list variable are always in
    exponential form.

4.  in sprint, if the name arg is "-", the string is printed instead
    of being used in a variable.

5.  The format string nat takes 'g' which incates to print using
    the SPICE multipliers in floating point format, e.g., 1.5m, 2.0k,
    etc.  The precision can now be set to 1 and 0 (integer part only
    and one dec place), these no longer revert to default 6.
