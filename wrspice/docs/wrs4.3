WRspice Generation 4 Release Notes

This is the 4.3 post-production series.  See the release note archive
for the production releases (4.2.1 - 4.2.16) and earlier.

The 4.3 branch is the first open-source release of the XicTools.  The
programs (Xic, WRspice, and others) are available at no cost, in
binary packages for selected operating systems, and as source code.

As open-source, there may well be many different versions of the
programs available.  As much as possible, these will be consolidated
into general releases, and tagged known-good releases will be issued
periodically.  The latest source code will be available directly from
the repository, for those wishing to track the latest.

Scroll down to the notes for the current WRspice release, which
follows some important general information.

*****************************************************
IMPORTANT -- General changes from 4.2 branch

1.  If you currently have XicTools programs installed from earlier
branches, it is strongly recommended that these be deleted.  This will
be managed automatically by the wr_install script.  Under Windows, you
can use wr_install under Cygwin, or you can run the cleanold.bat file
before installing 4.3 programs.  You should NOT delete the gtk2-bundle
packages for Windows and OS X, these are still required for 4.3.  Your
present releases of Xic and WRspice can be saved in Safe Install
format (even under Windows), and existing safe-installs won't be
affected.

2.  The Safe Install feature now applies to all packages, including
Microsoft Windows.  In Safe Install, when updating, the current
release is saved in its entirety, and can be easily reverted to if
necessary.  The Safe Install logic is now implemented with scripts
included in the distribution files, and no longer relies on use of
wr_install.

3.  Distribution file names, and operating system names, are a little
different now.  The new OSNAME format is now in the form NAME[.ARCH],
where the optional ARCH defaults to x86_64 if not given for Linux/OS
X, or i386 for Windows.

4.2 OSNAME    Corresponding 4.3 name
Darwin64        Darwin
LinuxRHEL5      LinuxRHEL5.i686
LinuxRHEL5_64   LinuxRHEL5
LinuxRHEL6_64   LinuxRHEL6
LinuxRHEL7_64   LinuxRHEL7
Win32           Win32

4.  The XicTools source repository was migrated to GIT from CVS.  The
source tree orgainzation was improved.  The build, packaging, and
package installation systems were extensively revised.  Previously
external accessories such as adms (used with WRspice), and fastcap and
fasthenry (used with Xic) were added to the XicTools collection.  New
packages sets for Fedora26 and OpenSUSE13 were added.

5.  You probably want to remove your existing adms package, if any. 
and install the new xictools adms package.  This provides a newer adms
release, integrated automatically with WRspice.

*****************************************************
IMPORTANT -- WRspice changes (these are the same as in 4.2.x)

The present WRspice has some differences that can affect simulation
results relative to pre-production or pre-Gen-4 releases.

1)  TMAX Limiting to TSTEP

  WRspice now limits the maximum internal time step to the printing time
  step (Tstep).  This is obtained from the tran line

  .tran Tstep Tstop [Tstart [Tmax]]     (simplified syntax)

  I.e., Tmax now defaults to Tstep.

  This was done to improve results from circuits containing only devices
  that weakly limit the time step (e.g.  MOSFETs) which otherwise can be
  ugly and wrong (e.g., ring oscillator results).  This allows users of
  such devices to get good results without having to set an explicit
  maximum time step in the tran line.

  However, if the printing time steps are very closely spaced, the
  simulation time can dramatically increase, since these points are now
  actually being calculated and not just interpolated.  The user in
  this situation has several options:

  1.  Accept the longer analysis time as the cost of greater accuracy.
  2.  Use a larger printing time increment (Tstep).
  3.  Use the Tmax parameter in the tran line to set a larger limit.
  4.  Use .options oldsteplim to use the old limit of (Tstop-Tstart)/50.

2)  Josephson Junction DC Operating Point Analysis

  The transient "uic" parameter is no longer virtually applied when
  Josephson junctions are present.  Instead, a dc operating point
  calculation is done, with Josephson junctions taken to have a very
  large conductance.  The operating range analysis is generally
  required for JJ/semiconductor hybrid circuits, but is most often
  redundant for purely Josephson circuits.

  This is all transparent to the user, except if the circuit contains
  inductor loops.  The operating point analysis, and therefor the
  transient analysis will fail in this case.  This can be remedied by
  giving the "uic" keyword explicitly in the tran command or .tran
  line, which causes the transient analysis to start with initial
  conditions and the operating point calculation is skipped.  Inductor
  loops are not a problem in this case.

3)  GMAX Resistance Limiting

  Resistor vales are limited to be larger than the reciprocal of the
  gmax parameter, which by default limits resistors to be 1 micro-ohm
  or larger.  Resistors of smaller value will be taken as the minimum
  value, and a warning message will be generated.

  Earlier releases limited the resistor values to 1 pico-ohm or
  larger, and there was no message if a resistor value was changed.

  Believe it or not, a circuit was submitted where this made a large
  difference in simulated results, unless gmax was set to the maximum
  value of 1e12.

4)  Node Name Parameter Expansion

  Node names are no longer parameter expanded (as of 4.1.12) by
  default.

  I know of at least one old deck where this feature was used.

  If the boolean variable pexnodes is set, then parameter expansion
  will occur, for backward compatibility.
*****************************************************
IMPORTANT  Mac users!

The Darwin64 package release is now generated on Sierra (10.12), but
the programs are fully compatible with El Capitan (10.11).

Support for earlier OS X releases has ended.  This is Apple's
decision, not mine.

*****************************************************
IMPORTANT -- Linux and OS X only

You should remove the following directories from your search path:
  usr/local/xictools/xic/bin
  usr/local/xictools/wrspice/bin
(assuming tools installed under /usr/local, this could be different).

These directories were required in your search path for earlier Xic
and WRspice, as part of Safe Install support.  In 4.3 releases, all
executables are linked into the
   /usr/local/xictools/bin
directory.

This directory should remain, or be added to your search path if not
already there (again /usr/local is the default, and should be replaced
by your actual installation location prefix).

*****************************************************
IMPORTANT -- Windows notes

  WINDOWS USERS SHOULD DO THE FOLLOWING:
  To avoid rendering problems with tree-view display components.
  Edit the file c:/usr/local/gtk2-bundle/etc/gtk-2.0/gtkrc
  Either comment out the line by adding a # character at the beginning,
  or replace the line with

    gtk-theme-name="MS-Windows"

  This changes the appearance of Xic and WRspice, which may look
  better to Windows users (I think so).

* DLL issues.

  The gtk2-bundle package must be installed to support any XicTools
  programs that use a graphical interface.  This is the same bundle as
  was used with 4.2.  You should NOT have the gtk2-bundle/bin in your
  search path, as it might then adversely affect operation of other
  programs.

  The programs that need the bundle DLLs should be run from the .bat
  files, i.e., xic.bat, wrspice.bat, and others.  These are installed
  by default in /usr/local/xictools/bin, which should be in your shell
  search path.

* Cygwin users:

  Cygwin now defaults to a new "mintty" terminal emulator.  This does
  NOT work AT ALL with WRspice, or any other native Windows
  application that interacts with the console.  The same applies to
  xterm and rvxt terminal emulators compiled under Cygwin.  These work
  better for running Xic, or running WRspice from Xic, where the
  terminal window is not interactive, but there are subtle problems so
  this is not recommended.

  WRspice can be run from the old-style native bash box, or a native
  DOS box.  For example, start a Command Prompt terminal window ("DOS
  box") from Windows, and give the commands
    cd c:\cygwin64\bin
    bash --login -i
  This gives the traditional Cygwin window, suitable for running
  WRspice.  This can be encapsulated in a bat file that can be run
  from an icon, there may be a c:/cygwin64/Cygwin.bat file in the Cygwin
  distribution that does exactly this.  If not, create a Cygwin.bat
  file somewhere with the contents
    @echo off
    C:
    chdir C:\cygwin64\bin
    bash --login -i
  This assumes that Cygwin in installed in C:\cygwin64, modify the
  file text appropriately if not.  Create a desktop icon that will
  run this bat file, and use it to launch Cygwin windows for running
  native Windows applications including WRspice and Xic.

  Note:  the 64-bit Cygwin64 is recommended over the 32-bit Cygwin,
  which suffers from internal problems due to conflicts with Windows
  Defender and other Windows programs.  This caused mysterious run-time
  failures of Cygwin programs on my Windows 10 machines.

*****************************************************
End of general info.


===============================================================================
wrspice-4.3.7  8/24/2018
Current Release

CHANGES AND NEW FEATURES
------- --- --- --------

* Updates to the Josephson junction models.

  These updates apply to both the internal and Verilog-A Josephson
  junction models.

  Added the LSER instance parameter to model junction series
  inductance.  This is intended to model geometric inductance of the
  Josephson junction structure, which looks lika a via.

  There are two new model parameters, LSH0 and LSH1, used to model the
  parasitic series inductance in the "external" shunt resistance
  assumed when using the VSHUNT parameter.  The shunt resistance
  series inductance will be

    L = LSH0 + Rshunt*LSH1

  LSH0 is a constant value intended to model end/via contributions. 
  LSH1 is inductance per ohm, intended to capture resistor length
  dependence.

  There is also a new instance parameter LSH, which will override the
  model parameters if also given.  This will set the value of the
  shunt resistor inductance directly.

  The following default parameter value and range changes were made
  to accommodate non-standard materials.
  vgap,min,,max   2.8mV,2.0mV,6.0mV    -> 2.6mV,0.1mV,10.0mV
  delv,min,max    0.08mV,0.01mV,0.2mV  -> 0.08mV,0.001*vgap,0.2*vgap

  Other evolution of the Verilog-A model, see the changes list in the
  model code.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
wrspice-4.3.6  7/20/2018

CHANGES AND NEW FEATURES
------- --- --- --------

* Updates to PULSE and GPULSE "tran" functions.

  Rewrote the basic framework tran function code, which now uses
  separate polymorphic classes, separate parse functions, etc.  for
  each function.  This is much cleaner and allows new functionality to
  be added more easily.

  The PULSE and GPULSE functions now provide a patterning capability
  similar to the HSPICE pattern source.  Both PULSE and GPULSE have the
  same basic argument format:

  PULSE {single pulse descr} {period and additional delays} {pattern spec}

  The initial options describe a single pulse.  This is followed by
  an optional period and additional delays.  If a period is given and
  nonzero, pulses will be emitted at the delay plus multiples of the
  period.  The period can be followed by additional delays, where a
  pulse is emitted at each delay, and multiples of the period
  thereafter if the period is nonzero.

  This is followed by "bstring" constructs which define a pattern for
  the periodic pulses.  A bstring is an arbitrarily long word starting
  with 'b' and continuing with 0 and 1 to indicate absence or presence
  of a pulse, in the corresponding period, as the sequence is read
  left to right.  A bstring can be immediately followed by two options:

    R [= number]

  The R options sets the repetition count of the preceding bstring. 
  If no number follows, a value of one (repeat once) is assumed.  If
  the number is negative, the repetition will continue indefinitely.
  If not given, or the number is 0, there is no repetition.

    RB = N

  This sets the bit in the bstring where repetitions commence, the
  following integer must be in the range of 1 to the bstring patern
  length.  If not given a value of 1 (repeat the whole sequence) is
  implied.

  Any number of bstrings and their options can be given, the patterns
  are concatenated.

* New passive element M parameter, inductor model.

  Inductor devices can now specify a model, consistent with resistor
  and capacitor devices.  At present, there is only one model
  parameter:  M, described below.  Future development will make use of
  this capability.

  The inductor instance now accepts a parameter "l" which is a synonym
  for "ind" and "inductance" as the given inductance.

  The resistor implementation was updated to allow preloading of
  constant resistance to avoid loading during transient analysis (for
  speed).  Nonlinear resistors are now handled properly in phase-mode
  DC analysis.

  Resistor, capacitor, and inductor devices and models all accept a new
  parameter "M".  This is a "parallel multiplier", and as a real number
  indicates the how many devices are effectively connected in parallel.

  The M instance parameter if given overrules M given in the model. 
  The effect of M is to alter the component value, as below.

     actual R  = given R / M
     actual L  = given L / M
     actual C  = given C * M

* New syntax element .DEFMOD, default model setting.

  Some simple devices support a "default model" in WRspice, meaning
  that if no model name is given in an instance line, an internally
  provided default model will be used.  Internally, all devices have a
  model structure, which is a container for the instances of that
  device type.  It is now possible to access the default model used
  for various devices with .defmod lines.

  .defmod Name ( name=val... )

  The Name is the name of the device model (the second name that would be
  provided on a .model line) such as R (for resistors), C (for capacitors),
  and L (for inductors).

  The name is followed by a list of parameter assignments, optionally
  enclosed in parentheses.  These are precisely the same as would
  appear in a .model line for the device.  These provide the values
  for the parameters to be used in the default model.

  Not all devices support default models, meaning that lack of a model
  name in an instance line is an error.  In particular devices that
  have a variable terminal count (optional nodes) require a model name
  and therefor don't support a default model.

  It is probably also not possible to use a LEVEL parameter in a
  default model, and binning parameters will be ignored at best. 
  Anything too fancy should be done through a normal model, or there
  may be trouble.

  The capability is very powerful, but might cause headaches, too, so
  the user should beware.

  For example, if the following line is added to an existing deck
    .defmod R(M=1.2)
  all "standard" resistors in the deck will have their values reduced
  by about 20%.  This can be useful for corner analysis, but don't
  let the line get "lost" in a big file.

* Options added to dump command, and related:

  Previously, there was an arbitrary mapping performed between node
  numbers and matrix indices.  This was probably to avoid
  non-contiguous matrix column/row numbers, but in WRspice this
  mapping is not needed and is no longer performed.  This saves a
  little time, and facilitates use of the dump command to do circuit
  debugging.  Any difference between node numbers and matrix indices
  is now only the result of internally performed reordering to improve
  matrix stability.

  If the "undocumented" option "translate" is given, translation will
  be done as it has been previously.

  The dump command, which dumps the last circuit matrix used to
  standard output, now accepts the following new options.

  -c  Use compact form, just show which entries are nonzero, using
      'x' for nonzero and '.' for zero.

  -r  Show the reordered matrix.

  -t  Terse, don't show header.

  -f filename   Send output to filename


BUGS FIXED
---- -----

* Handling of the tsfactor JJ model param fixed, now works
  consistently between internal and Verilog models.

* Fixes to avoid leaving empty temporary files behind after normal
  program exit.

* Linear controlled sources were not working with extended precision,
  bug fixed.

* The lossless transmission line model was updated to avoid excessive
  memory use.

* Fixed a bug in the Pade transmission line model that would impede DC
  operating point convergence (error in the stamp loaded for DC analysis).


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
wrspice-4.3.5  4/21/2018

CHANGES AND NEW FEATURES
------- --- --- --------

* More changes to the JJ models (Verilog-A and internal)

  The accepted range of icrit is now 1nA - 0.1A, which should be
  adequate to cover special cases.  The previous range was fine for
  digital circuits but was too restrictive in general.

  The range ov vgap is now 2.0mV - 6.0mV to cover materials other than
  niobium.


BUGS FIXED
---- -----

* The new Josephson junction model documentation did not make it into
  the packages other than LinuxRHEL7, or into the source tree. 
  Infrastructure was added to the build system to prevent this from
  happening in the future.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
wrspice-4.3.4  4/9/2018

This is basically a re-release of 4.3.3, with some documentation
additions and a few tweaks.  The 4.3.3 packages were never built.

CHANGES AND NEW FEATURES
------- --- --- --------

* Lots of new documentation added for JJ model, and Verilog-A support.

* The analysis("smsig") feature added in the last release was removed.
  replaced by $simparam("smsllsig").

* Small tweaks and fine-tuning of JJ internal and Verilog-A models.  The
  VM and ICRN parameters are now accepted in volts instead of millivolts.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
wrspice-4.3.3  3/28/2018

CHANGES AND NEW FEATURES
------- --- --- --------

* Modified adms scripts to provide support for real-value arrays.

* Updated the Verilog-A Josephson junction model with better
  conditioned equations and better tracking with the WRspice internal
  JJ model.  THis is a major update with lots of new parameters and
  capability.  A separate document for this model (and the internal
  JJ model) is forthcoming.

* Update the the gpulse "tran" function.

  The "pw" is now interpreted as the full-width half-maximum value.
  Previously, this was the full width at peak/e, i.e., the "variance"
  of the gaussian.  If pw is given negative, it will be interpreted
  in the old way as a positive value.

  If pw is given as 0 or not given, the source now generates SFQ
  pulses with the given amplitude and computed width.  As before, if
  the amplitude is 0, output is SFQ with the amplitude computed from
  the (nonzero) pw given.  If both amplitude and pw are zero, the SFQ
  FWHM is taken as the transient analysis TSTEP, and the amplitude is
  computed.

* Completely new DC analysis capability when Josephson junctions
  are present.

  A new phase-based computation provides real operating-point and DC
  sweep analysis when Josephson junctions are present.  This is an
  important advance, which should avoid the long-standing need to use
  "uic" and ramp sources up from zero.  This also avoids the previous
  hack of using a small resistance value for JJs in OP analysis, which
  could avoid using "uic" but would cause startup transients that
  could cause non-convergence.

  For DC analysis, Josephson junctions require special treatment.
  The usual SPICE voltage-based calculation can't be used, since
  1. all (or most) node voltages are identically zero,
  2. inductors can't be shorted, since they contribute to the
     current distribution,
  3. quantum mechanical "phase" must be quantized around
     JJ/inductor loops.

  We get around this by using phase for josephson junctions,
  inductors, and possibly inductor-like devices such as lossless
  transmision lines.  Every node connected to a Josephson junction or
  inductor has a "Phase" flag set.  This indicates that the computed
  value is phase, and NOT voltage, for these nodes.  We have to
  special-case the load functions of inductors and mutual inductors
  (and lossless transmission lines), and resistors.  Other devices can
  probably be treated normally, however there will be limitations, as
  noted below.

  A JJ can be modeled by the basic formula I = Ic*sin(V(i,j)), where
  V(i,j) is the "voltage" difference between nodes i and j, which is
  actually the phase.  Inductors look like resistors, L*I =
  V(i,j)*phi0/(2*pi), where again V(i,j) is the phase difference
  across the inductor.  Mutual inductance adds similar cross terms.

  Capacitors are completely ignored.  The treatment of resistors is
  slightly complicated.  The connected nodes can each be "Ground",
  "Phase", or "Voltage".  If both nodes are Ground or Voltage, the
  resistor is loaded normally.  If both nodes are Phase or Ground, the
  resistor is not loaded at all.  The interesting cases are when one
  node is Phase, the other Voltage.  In this case, we load the
  resistor as if the phase node is actually Ground (number = 0).  In
  addition, we load a VCCS template which injects current into the
  phase node, of value V(voltage-node)/resistance.  The form is
  actually quite simple.

  Resistors are the bridge between the normal voltage-mode devices and
  phase nodes.  Some circuits may require introduction of resistors to
  get correct results.  For example, assume a JJ gate driving a CMOS
  comparator circuit.  If the input MOSFET gate is connected directly
  to the JJ device, the DCOP will be incorrect, as the comparator will
  see phase as its input.  However, if a resistor separates the MOS
  gate from the JJ, the comparator input will be zero, as it should
  be.

  There is (at present) a topological requirement that all phase nodes
  must be at ground potential.  This means that for a network of JJs
  and inductors, there must be a ground connection to one of these
  devices.  A voltage source connected to an inductor, which is
  connected to a resistor to ground, although a perfectly valid
  circuit, will fail.  One must use the equivalent consisting of the
  voltage source connected to a resistor, connected to the inductor
  which is grounded.  This satisfies the two topological requirements:

    Rule 1:  There must be a resistor between a voltage-mode device
             and a phase mode device, no direct connections.

    Rule 2:  Every phase-node subnet must have a direct connection to
             ground, so all phase nodes are at ground potential.

  With this bit of information, and the warning that controlled
  sources can cause unexpected behavior, the DC analysis using this
  technique can apply to general circuits. 

  Note that for this to work, all JJs must have bias current less than
  their Ic.  Both DCOP and DC sweep analysis are available, as is AC
  analysis.  These are supported by both the internal and new Verilog
  models.  In addition, SPICE-style NOISE analysis is showing signs of
  life with the internal model.

* The "update" command (to save tool window configuration) is now
  called "tbupdate" to avoid a keyword clash with the program update
  function in the help system.

* New Verilog analysis() system function keyword added:  "smsig"
  This returns true when the simulator is loading small-signal values
  before AC analysis.  Somehow the Verilog-A designers neglected to
  include this, as the function returns most other states of interest.

* Multiple analysis runs are now done in file order per analysis type,
  used to be the reverse.  The order of analysis types is hard-coded
  in WRspice.

* Updated and augmented the Josephson junction examples.

BUGS FIXED
---- -----

* The dump command was printing incorrect imaginary values for complex
  matrices.

* DC operating point convergence failure is now a "fail" point in
  operating range and Monte Carlo analysis rather than a fatal error.

* Bug fixed in mutual inductor code, initial transient starting point
  would not be correct if set from nonzero initial condition.  Works
  fine when ramping from zero, however.

* There was a problem with "tran" functions, specifically PULSE, being
  called in DC sweep analysis, with the swept voltage as "time". 
  This should only happen for PWL.  Fixed.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
wrspice-4.3.2  10/29/2017

CHANGES AND NEW FEATURES
------- --- --- --------

* New package management system

  The existing system which automatically checks for updated packages
  has been removed, and a new package management system is available. 
  The system for sending messages to users through the wrcad.com web
  site, which was never used, has also been removed.  Presently, there
  is no internet access attempted on program startup, which saves
  time.

  The new package management page is build into the help system, so is
  available in Xic, WRspice, and in the stand-alone mozy help browser. 
  Giving the keyword/url

    :xt_pkgs

  displays a page showing the installed and available xictools
  packages.  Available packages can be downloaded and installed
  through this interface.  This can also be accessed with the
  wrupdate command.

  The following items have been removed from WRspice and the
  documentation:
    XT_NO_CHECK_UPDATE  environment variable
    XT_UPD_DEBUG        environment variable
    nocheckupdate       variable
    installcmdFmt       variable
    passwd              command
    proxy               command

  The proxy functionality has also been moved the the help system,
  through a new Set Proxy button in the Options menu of the help
  windows.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
wrspice-4.3.1  10/1/2017

Welcome the the first open-source release of WRspice.  Now, instead of
asking Whiteley Research for new features, users can modify the source
code and do it themselves.  Please contribute!  We can help.

Changes are relative to the final production release wrspice-4.2.16.


CHANGES AND NEW FEATURES
------- --- --- --------

* Major refactoring due to lack of C++ standards conformance
  throughout the program, which caused real trouble with the latest
  C++ compilers.

  Specifically, it used to be possible to write very efficient
  linked-list code in C++ making use of the assumption that it is
  possible to call a method from a non-polymorphic class through a
  null pointer, and check for a null "this" pointer in the function
  body.  One could iterate over the list headed by "this" and have
  correct behavior when the list is empty.  This idiom was not
  uncommon, though it violated the official dictum that calling a
  method from a null object leads to undefined behavior.  The idiom
  was used in the Microsoft Foundation Class, for example.  Surely,
  the elegance and efficiency would obviously lead to de-facto
  standardization, right?  Alas, such code generates a warning in
  Apple's latest clang, and in addition segmentation faults in gcc-7.1
  under Fedora 26.  This code had to be replaced by static functions
  that explicitly pass an object pointer.  Uglier, more complex code,
  but it works.  This is an unfortunate step backward for "a better C
  than C" aspect of C++.

* Major effort to clean up core leaks and other internal consistency
  issues using the Valgrind analysis tool.  Lots of small things were
  fixed as a result.

* Miscellaneous changes required in port to Fedora 26, mostly in
  interprocess communication code.

* Print Control Panel updated.

  The Print Control Panel has changed.  When the PostScript Line-Draw
  driver is chosen, a new Line Width entry area becomes visible.  This
  can be used to set the line width as rendered in the plot, in points
  (1/72 in).  The default is "0", which means to use the minimum line
  width supported by the printer.

  The Portrait/Landscape selection is now a drop-down menu instead of
  radio buttons, and some controls have changed location a bit.
  
* The wrspice --v option now produces three tokens: version osname arch
  E.g., 4.3.1 LinuxRHEL7 x86_64

* Other small tweaks here and there.


BUGS FIXED
---- -----

* The default path to Xic was incorrect.

* In Monte Carlo analysis, the compose call for checkPNTS (e.g.)
  would try and delete and replace the vector, which was prevented and
  a message issued since the plot active flag would be set.
