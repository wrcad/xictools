-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the central list of things to address in WRspice.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Complaints that having a lot of coupled transmission lines slows down
analysis substantially.

Saving fonts should be easier, the text in docs needs updating.
  Add a "save fonts" button in font selection panel.
  Make sure that all windows resize when fonts changed (toolbar doesn't).
  Separate GTK2 and Qt fonts in .wrspiceinit?

Globally change flag parameter logic so that declaration in assignment
form to 0 will NOT set the flag.

Quentin:
Increase the upper limit of vshunt to allow large value to effectively
remove shunting.

// Recent fixes
WRspice Options/Source caused seg fault (fixed).
mmjco is broken (fixed, missing 'e' in Boltzmann constant).
Plot windows Separate and Single buttons missing (fixed).
Dragging plot from file cabinet with only one trace showing didn't work (fixed).
