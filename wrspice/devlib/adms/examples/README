ADMS Compilation Examples
-------------------------

This directory contains a few "popular" Verilog-A devices as examples
for building loadable object modules for WRspice.

If you want the latest versions of these models, the link.mk file or
google will yield the original distribution sites, where a newer
revision may be available.  The Josephson junction model is a Whiteley
Research original, and the latest version is provided here.

You should copy this directory tree to your personal directory, as you
will need write permission to build the modules.  From the directory
above this one, give (for example)

  cp -r examples ~

to copy to your home directory.

You should be able to build the loadable modules by following the
instructions in the README files in the subdirectories.  The model
levels specified in the Makefiles were chosen to match CMC QA scripts,
or to match another simulator such as Hspice, spice3, or ngspice, or
were just made up.  These can be set to other values if desired, but
don't forget to also change the level parameters in the test files.

After building, or using the pre-built modules, you can start WRspice,
load the module, and run the test files.  The modules can be copied to
the wrspice/startup/devices directory in the installation area to be
loaded whenever WRspice starts.

Device modules are NOT COMPATIBLE with releases of WRspice other than
the one under which they were built.  If you have custom modules, they
must be rebuilt after a WRspice update.

A complete CMC QA script set for most of these models is available
from Whiteley Research as a separate download.
