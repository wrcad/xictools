This document describes the WRspice Josephson junction model.

I. derivation of the model.


The expression for the junction current is

   J = C*dV/dT + G(V) + Ic(Ci)*sin(P),	   (1)

where:
   J      is the total device current
   C      is the capacitance
   V      is the junction voltage
   G(V)   is the quasiparticle conductance
   Ci     is the control current
   Ic(Ci) is the supercurrent amplitude
   P      is the junction phase


The integration method is either trapezoidal or rectangular.  Thus for a new
time point for some variable X being integrated,

Trap:  X  = X0 + d*(X' + X0')/2		   (2)
       X' = -X0' + 2*(X - X0)/d		   (3)

Rect:  X  = X0 + d*X'			   (4)
       X' = (X - X0)/d			   (5)

Where:
   X    is the value at the present time point
   X0   is the value at the previous time point
   X'   is the time derivative at the present time point
   X0'  is the derivative at the previous time point
   d    is delta time


Thus, the first term in (1) can be expressed

   C*dV/dT ->  C*(-V0' + 2*(V - V0)/d)    [Trap]  (6)
	       C*(V - V0)/d               [Rect]  (7)

In the matrix formulation, one solves AV = I, where A is the coefficient
operator matrix, V is the node voltage vector, and I the source current 
vector.  To linearize the problem, one linearizes A, and modifies I with
the residue terms. 

For the capacitance term, the matrix element is the term which multiplies V.

   ELT = 2*C/d  [Trap]	 (8)
   ELT = C/d    [Rect]	 (9)

The RHS vector is modified as

   RHS = RHS + C*(V0' + 2*V0/d)	 [Trap]  (10)
   RHS = RHS + C*V0/d            [Rect]  (11)


The other terms, being generally nonlinear, are solved using Newton
iterations.  This is done by linearizing the terms around the previous
iteration result.  For the second term, one can write

   G(V) ~ G(VL) + (V - VL)*g	(12)

where:
   V     is the current voltage across the device
   G(V)	 is the present nonlinear current through the device
   VL    is the voltage calculated by the last Newton iteration
   G(VL) is the current at the last iteration
   g     is the derivative dG/dV evaluated at VL

Thus,

   ELT = g			 (13)
   RHS = RHS - G(VL) + VL*g	 (14)


The supercurrent term is slightly more complicated because there are two
independent variables.

   Ic(Ci)*sin(P) ~ (Ic(CiL) + (Ci-CiL)*Ic')*(sin(PL) + (P-PL)*cos(PL)) (15)

Neglecting terms second order in the difference,

   Ic(Ci)*sin(P) ~
      (Ic(CiL) + (Ci-CiL)*Ic')*sin(PL) + Ic(CiL)*(P-PL)*cos(PL)       (16)


The phase is given by dP/dt = V/Cp, where Cp is a constant.  Thus, using
(2-5) above,

   P = P0 + d*(V + V0)/(2*Cp)     [Trap]	(17)
   P = P0 + d*V/Cp                [Rect]	(18)

This holds for the last Newton interation as well

   PL = P0 + d*(VL + V0)/(2*Cp)   [Trap]	(19)
   PL = P0 + d*VL/Cp              [Rect]	(20)


Thus
    P - PL = d*(V - VL)/(2*Cp)   [Trap]	(21)
           = d*(V - VL)/Cp       [Rect]	(22)

Rewriting (16)

   Ic(Ci)*sin(P) ~
      (Ic(CiL) + (Ci-CiL)*Ic')*sin(PL) +
         Ic(CiL)*cos(PL)*(V-VL)*d/(2*Cp)  [Trap]  (23)

      (Ic(CiL) + (Ci-CiL)*Ic')*sin(PL) +
         Ic(CiL)*cos(PL)*(V-VL)*d/Cp	  [Rect]  (24)

There are two matrix elememts:

   ELTvv = Ic(CiL)*cos(PL)*d/(2*Cp)  [Trap]  (25)
   ELTvv = Ic(CiL)*cos(PL)*d/Cp      [Rect]  (26)

   ELTvi = Ic'*sin(PL)

The RHS term is modified accordingly

   RHS = RHS - Ic(CiL)*sin(PL) + CiL*Ic'*sin(PL)
                + Ic(CiL)*cos(PL)*VL*d/(2*Cp)	  [Trap]  (27)

   RHS = RHS - Ic(CiL)*sin(PL) + CiL*Ic'*sin(PL)
                + Ic(CiL)*cos(PL)*VL*d/Cp	  [Rect]  (28)


Define:
   crt  = Ic(CiL)*sin(PL)
   dcrt	= Ic'*sin(PL)
   ag   = 2/d if Trap, 1/d if Rect
   gcs  = Ic(CiL)*cos(PL)/(ag*Cp)

   ELTvv = gcs
   ELTvi = dcrt

   RHS   = RHS - crt + CiL*dcrt + VL*gcs
