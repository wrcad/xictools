--- Start of 4.3.X

Changes relative to final 4.2 release (4.2.16).

----- switch to git code control ------

The commit notes will in large measure replace this file, at least with
respect to documenting small changes.

The default path to xic was incorrect.

Fedora port: set SIGIO to SIG_IGN, so ipc works.

Bug fixed:  In Monte Carlo analysis, compose call for checkPNTS (e.g.)
would try and delete and replace the vector, which was prevented and
a message issued since the plot active flag is set.  Instead, the existing
vector is now kept but the data array updated, in new sDataVec::reset
method.

Made program separable from gnu-tainted mozy, with HAVE_MOZY.

ToDo:  option to set default line width for trace lines in plots for
line-draw drivers (Naveen, Hypres).
DONE: Print Control Panel updated, new entry for linewidth visible
when PS line draw driver is chosen.

--- release 4.3.1

Got rid of internal pkg updates
update docs for:
XT_NO_CHECK_UPDATE
XT_UPD_DEBUG
nocheckupdate
installcmdfmt

Commands:
wrupdate -> pops up update page in help
passwd -> gone
proxy  -> gone

--- release 4.3.2

Modified adms scripts to support arrays.

updated the Verilog-A JJ model and tweaked the internal model for
consistency.

Update to gpulse tran function.  pw is now FWHM pulse width, old interp
(as variance) if given negative.  If pw is 0, SFQ pulse with pw computed from
amplitude.

Completely new DCOP calculation when JJs are present.  This is a
phase-based calculation which will find the actual initial JJ and
inductor currents.  Conventional DC analysis is now feasible with JJs.

The update command (to save tool window configuration) is now "tbupdate"
to avoid clash with program update function.

The dump command printed incorrect values for the imaginary part of
complex matrices.

New non-portable Verilog-a analysis function keyword: smsig, for JJ
support.

Phase-mode DC analysis for JJs, lots of work.
Major update to JJ models, internal and Verilog.

DCOP failure is now a fail point on margin/MonteCarlo analysis instead
of fatal error.

Bug in mutual inductor code fixed.

Bug fixed, "tran" funcs like pulse were being called during dc sweeps
with voltage instead of time.  Mayber this was a feature?  No longer
happens except for pwl.

multiple analysis runs are done in file order for each analysis type,
ised top be the reverse.  The analysis order is built-in.

--- release 4.3.3

Update to the Verilog-A jjmodel,  $simparam("smallSig") instead of
$analysis("smsig").  Added internal support for this.

Minor updates to JJ model, sync with Verilog-A model.

Lots of new documentation for JJ model, and for Verilog-A support.

--- release 4.3.4

Documentation was not in update, due to the old stupid of updating copied
files, not the source.  Updated makefiles to check for this.

--- release 4.3.5

The lossless tra model uses far more memory than necessary.
In progress:  update to fix this.
The Pade level DCOP stamp was wrong, can causes DCOP convergence failure.
TLine update complete, for now.  todo: bulk allocate list elements,
or use array with head/tail pointer.

Now no longer separate allocation of node numbers in matrix, since original
node numbering is compact.  Saves a little overhead, maybe, and translation
vectors only show changes due to internal reordering.  New undocumented
option "translate" will force translation as in previous releases.

Added options to dump command:
-c  compact form, just show which entries are nonzero
-r  show reordered matrix
-t  terse, don't show header.

TODO:  Make sure WRspice cleans all files/directories under /tmp.  It
apparently does not.

NEW:  rewrote tran function code, now uses separate polymorphic structs,
separate parse funcs, etc.  Much cleaner.

GPULSE now handles additional delay arguments creating separate pulse
trains, same as PULSE.

PULSE and GPULSE now accept HSPICE-style "bstring" arguments that control
per-period on/off.

pulse ... [ bstring_elt [...]]
bstring_elt: bstring [r[=N]} [rb=M]
bstring: string starting with 'b', chars that follow are interpreted as "on"
or "off", off = 0,f,n,F,N  anything else is "on",  r == repeat count, -1
repeat forever.  rb is 1-based starting bit for repeat.

inductor now takes a model, only one parameter: M
R/L/C now all have M parameter, instance and model.  M will multiply the
device effective conductance (parallel multiplier).
L instance larameter 'l' new synonym for ind,inductance
R now uses preload when possible for speed, nonlinear resistors now handled
in phase mode.

new syntax element:
.defmod Name [(] name=val... [)]
Define parameters for the default model.  Not all devices support default
models, devices that don't have a fixed terminal count do not.  If no model
is given for a device, a default model will be used.  The .defmod line
allow parameter specification for this model, which will be used for all
devices of that type which don't have a model given explicitly.
Example:
.defmod R(M=1.2)
This will reduce the resistance of all resistors in the deck that don't have
a model explicitly given, or an overriding M given.

--- release 4.3.6

Update to JJ modesl (LSER, LSH parameters)

--- release 4.3.7

ToDo:
Matt,

You can give commands like "plot v(1) v2) ; plot (v3) v(4)" to get two     
plot windows.  Importantly, this works from the Xic prompt line when the
plot button is active, and you can click to define the vectors.  Just add
": plot" as plain text.

I plan to add a "group" option to the WRspice plot command, so one could     
have something like "plot v(1) v(2) -g v(3) v(4) -g i(v1) i(v2)" to obtain
three sub-plots containing the listed vectors.  These would be displayed
into the same window somehow, or perhaps separate windows.  The latter case
would be equivalent to "plot v(1) v(2) ; plot v(3) v(4) ; plot i(v1) i(v2)",
which should not be too difficult to implement.

Regards,
Steve

Model names and device instance keywords and model keywords are always
case insensitive.  Is this noted in docs?

--- release 4.3.8

Updates to support "atomic Monte Carlo" analysis, a script-based Monte
Carlo analysis where user has finer-grain control.
new command:  alterf  Dump alter list to Monte Carlo output file.
new command:  mctrial Run a single Monte Carlo trial, sets variable
named "trial_return" to 0-error, 1-pass, 2-fail.
The check command has new option: -b.  If this is given, the analysis will
be paused after setup and the check command will return.  This is the start
for atomic Monte Carlo, a script can call mctrial numerous times
at this point, then "check -c" when done.

check -c now returns immediately after deleting run in progress.
new check vector checkINIT, set to 1 for exec block for initial execution,
before op range or first MC trial.  Set to 0 otherwise.

Changed the character that separates numerator and denominator units from '/'
to '_', which is tied to the new "units_sepchar" variable.  The earlier
choice could cause ambiguous expressions.  e.g., 1/V  could be ine over
a vector V or one per volt.  Where is units stuff documented?

TODO:
Christine's file:  Windows singular matrix, ok under Linux.

Stats of multi-runs should accumulate.

Gleb crash (close window with running WRspice crashes WRspice).

Jooyoung sweep time anomaly: sweep not proportional to sim length.
Jooyoung: Verilog JJ model doesn't work in sweep/chained DC analysis.

Ground names are listed from sCKTnodeTab::groundNames().
ToDo: user command to set a ground name.

TODO
Add random bit 'x' in pattern gpulse/pulse.
TO-DO in .meassure, prinitive that will identify edge, bottom, and
top.

TODO
Use trial reset if alter only, otherwise rebuild.
New "frame" default plot support.

Check how expressions obtain current nodevoltages/branch currents,
past time point (bad) vs value being computed per iteration.

Experiment with alternative inductor stamp.

implement trace groups in plots

ADMS:  Implement "localparam", even if just an alias for "parameter".
