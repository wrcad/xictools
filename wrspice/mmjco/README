MMJCO - Tunnel Junction Amplitude calculator.
Version 0.5 (ALPHA)     9/3/2020
S. Whiteley,  wrcad.com, Synopsys, Inc.

This is derived from the MiTMoJCo project, specifically the
mitmojco.py environment that provides an interface for creating tunnel
junction amplitudes and fitting tables.

This has been implemented as two C++ classes, one for creating tunnel
junction amplitudes, which basically evaluates the Werthamer model as
formulated for MiTMoJCo by D.  R.  Gulevich, the second to compress
the amplitudes into a compact representation, as used by MiTMoJCo and
the TJM (JJ level=3) device model in WRspice.  The method is that of
Odintsov, Semenov, and Zorin (see mmjco.cc comments for literature
references).

++++ Building

One should be able to build on any Linux-like platform.

Presently, the file will build into a static library, and a
stand-alone application "mmjco" that will provide an interactive
interface for generating files containing tunnel junction amplitudes
and fitting tables.

Building requires the "devel" versions of the following libraries:

    GSL  (the Gnu Scientific library)  Version 1.15 is known to be ok.

The source now includes a release of cmpfit
https://pages.physics.wisc.edu/~craigm/idl/cmpfit.html
This provides a version of the venerable lmdif least-squares fitter
from MINPACK, an ancient fortran library.  As an alternative, one can
instead use:
    cminpack (a C/C++ version of the MINPACK optimization library)
    https://github.com/devernay/cminpack

This was the original target for mmjco, however it is a bit obscure,
and in particular I couldn't find it at Synopsys (though it is
provided in CentOS 7 repos).  This may be an issue for others so I
found and included cmpfit instead.

Once installed, tweak the Makefile if necessary to set the proper
paths to libraries for your system, and type "make".  If all goes well
the "mmjco" binary should be created in the current directory, along
with a libmmjco.a library file.

++++ Running

Presently, running mmjco enters a command-line processing loop, the user
responds to the "mmjco> " prompt with commands from the list below.  Each
command can be followed by options as indicated.

Text in square brackets ([...]) is optional.  A vertical pipe
character ( | ) indicates that either the text to the right or left is
acceptable, i.e., it separates options.

cd[ata]  [-t temp] [-d|-d1|-d2 delta] [-s smooth] [-x nx] [-f filename]

    Create TCA data, save internally and to a file.  See below for
    an explanation of the options.

cf[it]  [-n terms] [-h thr] [-f filename]

    Create fit parameters for TCA data currently in memory, from cd
    or ld commands.  This is saved internallyand to a file.  See
    below for an explanation of the options.

cm[odel]  [-h thr] [-f [filename]]

    Create a model for TCA data using fitting parameters currently in
    memory, compute the residual, and optionally save to a file.  If -f
    is given without a filename, a file name will be generated
    internally.  If -f is not given, the model will not be saved to a
    file, but used only to compute the residual.  The printed
    residual number is an indication of the fit quality, smaller
    values indicate better matching.

ld[ata] filename

    Load the internal TCA data register from a TCA data file whose name
    must be given.

lf[it] filename

    Load the internal fit parameters register from a fit parameter file
    given.

h[elp] | v[ersion] | ?

    Print help and the running mmjco release number.

q[uit] | e[xit]

    Exit the mmjco interface.

Tunnel current amplitude and smoothing options:

    -t   The assumed temperature follows, in Kelvin.  Default 4.2.

    -d   This will set both d1 and d2, the pair breaking energy in
         milli-electron volts, of the two superconducting banks.  The
         default is 1.4 mev.

    -d1  
    -d2  Like -d, but apply to only one of the banks.  The final
         occurrence of d,d1,d2 will have precedence.

    -s   This provides the smoothing parameter as used in MiTMoJCo.
         the accepted range is 0.0 - 0.099.  The default is 0.008.  If
         less than 0.001, 0 is assumed.  When 0, no smoothing is done
         and raw BCS tunnel amplitudes are generated.

    -x   The number of points used to create the tunnel current
         amplitudes.  The range of sweep of voltage normalized to the
         gap voltage (d1+d2) extends from 0.001 through 2.0.  The
         default point count is 500.

    -f   A name for the TCA anplitude file.  If not given, a
         default is used, described below.

Fitting table options:

    -n   The size of the table, defaults to 8.  Larger tables are
         more accurate but take more time to generate and process.
         A maximum of 20 is enforced..

    -h   The ratio of the absolute to relative tolerances, used in
         compression, the default is 0.2.

    -f   A name for the fitting parameter table.  If not given, a
         default is used, described below.

Running mmjco can generate two types files:  a file containing the
swept values of the tunnel current amplitudes, and a file containing
the fitting parameters used to represent the tunnel current amplitues
in a compact form.  The "model" files use the same format as the TCA
files.

By default, these files are given a name that encodes the various
parameter values used in creation.  This format is described below.

Tunnel current amplitude file name

    tcaTTTDD1DD2SFXXXX.data

The "tca" and ".data" are literal.  TTT is a three-digit integer equal
to 100*temp (truncated to integer).  DD1 and DD2 are three digit
integers equal to 100*d1 and 100*d2, truncated to integer.  SF is a
two digit integer representing the smoothing parameter equal to
1000*sf, truncated to integer.  The XXXX is the number of points used
(-x option), 0-padded if needed to fill out 4 integers,  Model files
use the same default name, however ".model" replaces ".data".

The fitting parameter file name has the form

    tcaTTTDD1DD2SFXXXX-NNHHH.fit

The first part, ahead of the '-', is as described above.  Following
the hyphen, NN is the zero-padded two-digit fitting table size.  This
is followed by the compression threshold, as a three digit integer
representing 1000*thr, truncated to integer.

The fit parameter table format is precisely that used by MiTMoJCo. 
Note that the table values do not match those found in the MiTMoJCo
distribution.  It seems that these values are not unique, and the
various programs can converge to different sets.  It was found that
the original and present versions of mitmojco.py gave different
values, and neither matched the values provided in the amplitudes
folder.
