    When a graphical interface is available, <i>WRspice</i> by default
    provides a small <b>Tool Control</b> window which provides menus
    for controlling <i>WRspice</i>, and a display containing a
    tabulation of memory statistics.  The menus contain buttons which
    bring up graphical screens, from which much most of <i>WRspice</i>
    can be controlled in a (perhaps) more user-friendly fashion.  The
    locations of the pop-ups and their active/inactive status at
    program startup can be preset by the user.

    <p>
    When running <i>WRspice</i> through the <i>Xic</i> program, by
    default the tool control window will appear when connection to
    <i>WRspice</i> has been established.  The <i>Xic</i> variable
    <b>NoSpiceTools</b> can be set, before the connection is
    established, to prevent the tool control window from appearing.

    <p>
    The text area lists the following quantities, though some may not
    be listed if the operating system does not provide this
    information.  The listing is updated every few seconds.  The first
    line of text shows the current running status of <i>WRspice</i>: 
    idle, running, or stopped.  Also shown on this line is the elapsed
    wall-clock time from the last status change.  The time format is
    hours:minutes:seconds.  The seconds entry has two decimal places
    (resolution is .01 second).  The hours field is not included if
    zero.  The <b>user</b> and <b>system</b> lines are similar, but
    display the total user cpu time used by the process, and the total
    system cpu time, respectively.  The user time generally includes
    input/output processing time, where the system time is pure cpu
    usage.  The <b>data size</b> entry displays the total allocated
    memory in Kb used by the program.  This is only the memory
    allocated by the program for data, and does not include additional
    memory overhead reported by programs such as <tt>top</tt> and
    <tt>ps</tt>.  This size is limited to the <b>program limit</b>,
    which is given in the following line.  This limit can be changed
    with the <a href="maxdata"><tt>maxdata</tt></a> variable.  The
    final <b>system limit</b> line displays the maximum memory
    available from the system for the process.

    <a name="dragdrop"></a>
    <h3>Drag and Drop</h3>

    <i>WRspice</i> supports the xdnd and Motif drag and drop
    protocols.  One is able to drag files from many file manager
    programs into the <b>Tool Control</b> window of <i>WRspice</i> or
    the main window of <i>Xic</i>, and that file will be loaded into
    the program.  The <a href="filemgr">File Selection</a> and <a
    href="filespanel">Files Listing</a> pop-ups participate in the
    protocols as sources and receivers.  The <a href="xeditor">text
    editor</a> and <a href="mailclient">mail</a> popups are drag
    receivers.

    <p>
    The file must be a standard file on the same machine.  If it is
    from a tar file, or on a different machine, first drag it to the
    desktop or to a directory, then into <i>WRspice</i>.  (Note:  The
    Gnome gmc file manager allows one to view the contents of tar
    files, etc.  as a "virtual file system".  Window Maker and
    Enlightenment window managers, at least, are drag/drop aware.)

    <a name="wrbtn"></a>
    <h3>WR Button</h3>

    In the upper left of the <b>Tool Control</b> window is the <b>WR
    button</b>, which contains the Whiteley Research corporate logo. 
    Pressing this button brings up a <a href="mailclient">mail
    client</a>, pre-loaded with the address of the Whiteley
    Research support staff.  The text field containing the address, as
    well as the subject, can be changed.  This can be used to send
    questions and bug reports to Whiteley Research, or to send
    messages or data files to colleagues.

    <a name="runstop"></a>
    <h3>Run/Stop Buttons</h3>

    To the right of the <b>WR</b> button are the <b>Run</b> (green
    arrow) and <b>Stop</b> (red X) buttons.  Pressing the <b>Run</b>
    button is equivalent to giving the <a href="run"><tt>run</tt></a>
    command on the command line, without arguments.  Pressing the
    <b>Stop</b> button issues an interrupt signal that will pause a
    simulation in progress, the same as if the user typed
    <b>Ctrl-C</b> in the console window.

    To the right of the buttons is a menu bar with four entries: 
    <b>File</b>, <b>Edit</b>, <b>Tools</b>, and <b>Help</b>.  Pressing
    the mouse button 1 on these entries brings up a drop-down menu
    containing various commands.

    <a name="filemenu"></a>
    <h3>File Menu</h3>

    The <b>File</b> menu contains commands for manipulating disk
    files.

    <dl>
    <dt><b>File Select</b>
    <dd>Bring up a <a href="filemgr">file manager</a> panel.  This
    panel allows files and directories to be created, deleted, and
    renamed, or read into <i>WRspice</i>.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Source</b>
    <dd>This button creates a dialog, soliciting a file to input into
    <i>WRspice</i>, as with the <a href="source"><b>source</b></a>
    command.  When the dialog is active, the <b>Tool Control</b> text
    window is active as a <a href="dragdrop">drag receiver</a>, so
    that file names can be dragged and dropped from compatible windows
    (such as the file manager), and the file name will be loaded into
    the dialog.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Load</b>
    <dd>This button is similar in operation to the <b>Source</b>
    button, however the file is expected to be a <a
    href="rawfilefmt">rawfile</a> which is the native plot-file
    format, or a Common Simulation Data Format (CSDF) file.  Like the
    <b>Source</b> dialog, the <b>Load</b> dialog supports drag and
    drop protocols through the text area of the <b>Tool Control</b>
    window.  The file is read and data are made available for
    analysis, similar to the <a href="load"><b>load</b></a> command.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Update Tools</b>
    <dd>The <b>Update Tools</b> button will save the current tool
    configuration, and the next time <i>WRspice</i> is started, the
    same tools will be available, in the same locations on-screen. 
    The tools are available in the <b>Tools</b> menu to be described.

    <p>
    Initialization of the graphical interface can be directed from the
    system <a href="startup_files">init file</a> <tt>wrspiceinit</tt>
    found in the startup directory, or more appropriately from the
    user's startup files (<tt>.wrspiceinit</tt> files) as found in the
    current or user's home directory.  Only the file in the home
    directory can be automatically updated from within <i>WRspice</i>. 
    A special command <a href="tbsetup"><b>tbsetup</b></a>, which is
    only recognized in these files, performs the initialization.  The
    <b>tbsetup</b> function takes a long, messy command line, however
    fortunately the user has an easy way to automatically add this
    line, using the <b>Update Tools</b> command.  This action is
    also available from the command line <a
    href="tbupdate"><b>tbupdate</b></a> command.

    <p>
    The <b>Update Tools</b> and <b>tbupdate</b> commands will create or
    update a <tt>.wrspiceinit</tt> file in the user's home
    directory.  If the home directory can't be determined, the current
    directory will be used.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Update WRspice</b>
    <dd>Pressing this button is equivalent to giving the <a
    href="wrupdate"><b>wrupdate</b></a> command, and is equivalent to
    giving the special keyword "<tt>:xt_pkgs</tt>" to the help system,
    which brings up the <i>XicTools</i> <a href="update">package
    management</a> page.  The page lists installed and available
    packages for each of the <i>XicTools</i> programs for the current
    operating system, and provides buttons to download and install the
    packages.

    <p>  
    Unlike in earlier <i>WRspice</i> releases, there is no provision
    for automatic checking for updates, so this command or equivalent
    should be run periodically to check for updated packages.  The
    computer must have http access to the internet for successful use
    of this functionality.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Quit</b>
    <dd>The <b>Quit</b> button will terminate the <i>WRspice</i>
    session, after confirmation if there is unsaved work.  This can
    also be accomplished with the <tt>quit</tt> or <tt>exit</tt>
    command line functions.
    </dl>

    <a name="editmenu"></a>
    <h3>Edit Menu</h3>

    The <b>Edit</b> menu contains commands used to modify input files.

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Text Editor</b>
    <dd>This button brings up a <a href="xeditor">text editor</a>,
    similar to the <tt>edit</tt> command.  The default text editor is
    <a href="xeditor">xeditor</a>, but the user can specify a
    different editor with the <b>EDITOR</b> or <b>SPICE_EDITOR</b> <a
    href="environment">environment</a> variables, or with the <a
    href="editor"><tt>editor</tt></a> variable.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Xic</b>
    <dd>This button launches the <i>Xic</i> program, if it is
    available.
    </dl>

    <p>
    For schematic capture, the <i>Xic</i> program must be installed. 
    When either editor is started, the currently loaded circuit, if
    any, and if it has graphical information in the case of
    <i>Xic</i>, is loaded into the editor.  The simulation process can
    be initiated and controlled through <i>Xic</i>.  The internal text
    editor has a <b>Source</b> button, which allows the modified
    circuit to be passed directly back to <i>WRspice</i> for
    simulation.  If another editor is used, changes will have to be
    saved to disk and sourced from <i>WRspice</i>.

    <a name="toolsmenu"></a>
    <h3>Tools Menu</h3>

    The <b>Tools</b> menu contains a configurable collection of
    command buttons which initiate pop-ups which control or display
    various aspects or <i>WRspice</i>.  Each of these pop-ups is a
    graphical short cut to a collection of command line commands. 
    Many users prefer the point-and-click interface to the command
    line, though some do not.  With <i>WRspice</i>, the user has a
    choice.  The command functions available in the <b>Tools</b> menu
    are listed below, in the order found in the menu.

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Fonts</b><dd>
    This brings up the <a href="fontspanel"><b>Font Selection</b></a>

\index{tool control window}
When a graphical interface is available, {\WRspice} by default
provides a small {\cb Tool Control} window which provides menus for
controlling {\WRspice}, and a display containing a tabulation of
memory statistics.  The menus contain buttons which bring up graphical
screens, from which much most of {\WRspice} can be controlled in a
(perhaps) more user-friendly fashion.  The locations of the pop-ups
and their active/inactive status at program startup can be preset by
the user.

When running {\WRspice} through the {\Xic} program, by default the
{\cb Tool Control} window will appear when connection to {\WRspice}
has been established.  The {\Xic} variable {\et NoSpiceTools} can be
set, before the connection is established, to prevent the {\cb Tool
Control} window from appearing.

\index{memory statistics}
The text area lists the following quantities, though some may not be
listed if the operating system does not provide this information. 
The listing is updated every few seconds.  The first line of text
shows the current running status of {\WRspice}:  idle, running, or
stopped.  Also shown on this line is the elapsed wall-clock time
from the last status change.  The time format is
hours:minutes:seconds.  The seconds entry has two decimal places
(resolution is .01 second).  The hours field is not included if
zero.  The {\cb user} and {\cb system} lines are similar, but display
the total user cpu time used by the process, and the total system cpu
time, respectively.  The user time generally includes input/output
processing time, where the system time is pure cpu usage.  The {\cb
data size} entry displays the total allocated memory in Kb used by the
program.  This is only the memory allocated by the program for data,
and does not include additional memory overhead reported by programs
such as {\vt top} and {\vt ps}.  This size is limited to the {\cb
program limit}, which is given in the following line.  This limit can
be changed with the {\et maxdata} variable.  The final {\cb system
limit} line displays the maximum memory available from the system for
the process.

\index{drag and drop}
{\WRspice} supports the {\et xdnd} and {\et Motif} drag and drop
protocols.  One is able to drag files from many file manager programs
into the {\cb Tool Control} window of {\WRspice} or the main window of
{\Xic}, and that file will be loaded into the program.  The File
Selection and Files Listing pop-ups participate in the protocols as
sources and receivers.  The text editor and mail pop-ups are drag
receivers.

The file must be a standard file on the same machine.  If it is from a
tar file, or on a different machine, first drag it to the desktop or
to a directory, then into {\WRspice}.  (Note:  The GNOME {\vt gmc}
file manager allows one to view the contents of tar files, etc.  as a
``virtual file system''.  Window Maker and Enlightenment window
managers, at least, are drag/drop aware.)

\index{WR button}
In the upper left of the {\cb Tool Control} window is the {\cb WR}
button, which contains the Whiteley Research corporate logo.  Pressing
this button brings up a mail client (see \ref{mailclient}), pre-loaded
with the address of the Whiteley Research support staff.  The text
field containing the address, as well as the subject, can be changed. 
This can be used to send questions and bug reports to Whiteley
Research, or to send messages or data files to colleagues.

To the right of the {\cb WR} button are the {\cb Run} (green arrow)
and {\cb Stop} (red X) buttons.  Pressing the {\cb Run} button is
equivalent to giving the {\cb run} command on the command line,
without arguments.  Pressing the {\cb Stop} button issues an interrupt
signal that will pause a simulation in progress, the same as if the
user typed {\kb Ctrl-C} in the console window.

To the right of the buttons is a menu bar with four entries:  {\cb
File}, {\cb Edit}, {\cb Tools}, and {\cb Help}.  Pressing the mouse
button 1 on these entries brings up a drop-down menu containing
various commands.

The {\cb File} menu contains commands for manipulating disk files.

\begin{description}
\item{\cb File Select}\\
Bring up a file manager panel.  This panel allows files and
directories to be created, deleted, and renamed, or read into
{\WRspice}.  The file manager is described in \ref{filemgr}.

\item{\cb Source}\\
This button creates a dialog, soliciting a file to input into
{\WRspice}, as with the {\cb source} command.  When the dialog is
active, the {\cb Tool Control} text window is active as a drag
receiver, so that file names can be dragged and dropped from
compatible windows (such as the file manager), and the file name will
be loaded into the dialog.

\item{\cb Load}\\
This button is similar in operation to the {\cb Source} button,
however the file is expected to be a rawfile, which is the native
plot-file format, or a Common Simulation Data Format (CSDF) file. 
Like the {\cb Source} dialog, the {\cb Load} dialog supports drag and
drop protocols through the text area of the {\cb Tool Control} window. 
The file is read and data are made available for analysis, similar to
the {\cb load} command.

\item{\cb Update Tools}\\
The {\cb Update Tools} button will save the current tool
configuration, and the next time {\WRspice} is started, the same tools
will be available, in the same locations on-screen.  The tools are
available in the {\cb Tools} menu to be described.

Initialization of the graphical interface is directed from the system
init file {\vt wrspiceinit} found in the startup directory, or more
appropriately from the user's startup files ({\vt .wrspiceinit} files)
as found in the current or user's home directory.  Only the file in
the home directory can be automatically updated from within
{\WRspice}.  A special command {\vt tbsetup}, which is only recognized
in these files, performs the initialization.  The {\vt tbsetup}
function takes a long, messy command line, however fortunately the
user has an easy way to automatically add this line, using the
{\cb Update Tools} command.  This action is also available from the
command line {\cb tbupdate} command.

The {\cb Update Tools} and {\cb tbupdate} commands will create or
update a {\vt .wrspiceinit} file in the user's home directory.  If the
home directory can't be determined, the current directory will be
used.

\item{\cb Update WRspice}\\
Pressing this button is equivalent to giving the {\cb wrupdate}
command, and is equivalent to giving the special keyword ``{\vt
:xt\_pkgs}'' to the help system, which brings up the {\XicTools}
package management page (see \ref{update}).  The page lists
installed and available packages for each of the {\XicTools} programs
for the current operating system, and provides buttons to download and
install the packages.

Unlike in earlier {\WRspice} releases, there is no provision for
automatic checking for updates, so this command or equivalent should
be run periodically to check for updated packages.  The computer must
have http access to the internet for successful use of this
functionality.

\item{\cb Quit}\\
The {\cb Quit} button will terminate the {\WRspice} session, after
confirmation if there is unsaved work.  This can also be accomplished
with the {\cb quit} or {\cb exit} command line functions.
\end{description}

The {\cb Edit} menu contains commands used to modify input files.

\begin{description}
\item{\cb Text Editor}\\
This button brings up a text editor, similar to the {\cb edit}
command.  The default text editor is described in \ref{textedit},
but the user can specify a different editor with the {\et EDITOR} or
{\et SPICE\_EDITOR} environment variables, or with the {\et editor}
variable.

\item{\cb Xic}\\
This button launches the {\Xic} program, if it is available.
\end{description}

For schematic capture, the {\Xic} program must be installed.  When
either editor is started, the currently loaded circuit, if any, and if
it has graphical information in the case of {\Xic}, is loaded into the
editor.  The simulation process can be initiated and controlled
through {\Xic}.  The internal text editor has a {\cb Source} button,
which allows the modified circuit to be passed directly back to
{\WRspice} for simulation.  If another editor is used, changes will
have to be saved to disk and sourced from {\WRspice}.

\index{Tools menu}
The {\cb Tools} menu contains a configurable collection of command
buttons which initiate pop-ups which control or display various
aspects or {\WRspice}.  Each of these pop-ups is a graphical short cut
to a collection of command line commands.  Many users prefer the
point-and-click interface to the command line, though some do not. 
With {\WRspice}, the user has a choice.  The command functions
available in the {\cb Tools} menu are listed below, in the order found
in the menu.

\begin{description}
\item{\cb Fonts}\\
\index{Fonts tool}
This brings up the {\cb Font Selection} panel (see \ref{fontspanel})
that allows selection of the font used in the text areas of the
various tools, and in plot windows used for displaying simulation
results.

\item{\cb Files}\\
\index{Files tool}
Pop up the {\cb Path Files Listing} panel (see \ref{filespanel}) which
displays a list of the files found along the {\et sourcepath}.  Files
can be sourced or edited through this panel.

\item{\cb Circuits}\\
\index{Circuits tool}
Bring up the {\cb Circuits} panel (see \ref{circuitspanel}) listing
the circuits that are currently in memory.  The panel provides
capabilities for choosing the current circuit and deleting circuits
from memory.

\item{\cb Plots}\\
\index{Plots tool}
Bring up the {\cb Plots} panel (see \ref{plotspanel}) which displays a
list of the plots in memory.  The panel provides capabilities for
selecting the current plot, and for deleting plots.

\item{\cb Plot Opts}\\
\index{Plot Options tool}
Bring up the {\cb Plot Options} panel (see \ref{plotopts}) to
control the myriad of variables associated with plotting.

\item{\cb Colors}\\
\index{Colors tool}
Bring up the{\cb Plot Colors} panel (see \ref{colors}) to set the
colors used in the plots.

\item{\cb Vectors}\\
\index{Vectors tool}
Pop up the {\cb Vectors} panel (see \ref{vectorspanel}) listing the
vectors in the current plot.  The panel provides an interface for
plotting or printing these vectors.

\item{\cb Variables}\\
\index{Variables tool}
Pop up the {\cb Variables} panel (see \ref{variablespanel}) displaying
the shell variables currently set.

\item{\cb Shell}\\
\index{Shell tool}
Bring up the {\cb Shell Options} panel (see \ref{shellopts}) used to
control the default settings associated with the {\WRspice} shell.

\item{\cb Sim Opts}\\
\index{Simulation Options tool}
Pop up the {\cb Simulation Options} panel (see \ref{simopts}) used
to modify the variables which affect circuit simulation.

\item{\cb Commands}\\
\index{Commands tool}
