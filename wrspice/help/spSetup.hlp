    Instructions for downloading and installing the <i>WRspice</i>
    distribution files can be found in the "Binary Distribution
    Repository" link on <a href="http://wrcad.com">wrcad.com</a>.

    <p>
    If the program is installed in the default location under
    <tt>/usr/local</tt>, the installation should be complete. 
    Otherwise, the <b>XT_PREFIX</b> (and/or some other) <a
    href="environment">environment</a> variables should be set in
    order for <i>WRspice</i> to locate things such as the help
    database.  Commands to set these environment variables should be
    added to the user's shell startup file.

    <p>
    If the installation host is to be used as a SPICE server for
    remote client access, the <a href="wrspiced"><tt>wrspiced</tt></a>
    daemon must be enabled, after some minor configuration.

    <p>
    <i>WRspice</i> can be customized through the <a
    href="startup_files">startup file</a>, if necessary.

    The <i>XicTools</i> package has been developed primarily under
    BSD-4.4 Unix (FreeBSD), which is the reference operating
    system.  The tools have also been ported to Linux, SunOS, Solaris,
    Alpha-OSF, Ultrix, and HPUX.  The tools are now available
    for Microsoft Windows, WinXP and newer.

Environment Variables
!!HTML
    Environment variables are keyword/value pairs that are made
    available to an application by the command shell or operating
    system.  The value of an environment variable is a text string,
    which may be empty.  Environment variables can be set by the user
    to control various defaults in <i>WRspice</i>.

    <h3>Unix/Linux</h3>

    Environment variables are maintained by the user's command shell. 
    It is often convenient to set environment variables in a shell
    startup file such as <tt>.cshrc</tt> or <tt>.login</tt> for the
    C-shell or <tt>.profile</tt> for the Bourne shell.  These files
    reside in the user's home directory.  See the manual page for your
    shell for more information.

    <p>
    For the C-shell, the command that sets an environment variable is
    <blockquote>
        <tt>setenv</tt> <i>variable_name</i> [<i>value</i>]
    </blockquote>
    For example,
    <blockquote>
        <tt>setenv XT_DUMMY "hello world!"</tt>
    </blockquote>
    Note that if the value contains white space, it should be quoted. 
    Note also that it is not necessary to have a value, in which case
    the variable acts as a boolean (set or not set).

    <p>
    In the C-shell, one can use <tt>setenv</tt> without arguments, or
    <tt>printenv</tt>, to list all of the environment variables
    currently set.

    <p>
    For a modern Bourne-type shell, such as <tt>bash</tt>, the
    corresponding command is
    <blockquote>
        <tt>export</tt> <i>variable_name</i>[=<i>value</i>]
    </blockquote>
    In this type of shell one can list the variables currently set by
    giving the shell <tt>set</tt> command with no arguments.

    <h3>Microsoft Windows</h3>

    Under Windows, environment variables can be set in a DOS box with
    the "<tt>set</tt>" command before starting the program from the
    command line, or in the <tt>AUTOEXEC.BAT</tt> file, or from the
    <b>System</b> entry in the <b>Control Panel</b>.  Only the latter
    two methods work if the programs are started from an icon.  If
    using a Cygwin bash-box, environment variables can be set in the
    startup file as under Unix.

    <p>
    <i>WRspice</i> is <b>not</b> compatible with the <tt>mintty</tt>
    terminal emulator which is the current default in Cygwin.  Only
    Cygwin-built programs work properly from this terminal if they
    use a command line interface.

    <h3><i>WRspice</i> Environment Variables</h3>

    The following environment variables are used by all <i>XicTools</i>
    programs.

    <p>
    <a name="WRSPICE_HOME"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>WRSPICE_HOME</b>
    <dd>
    If found in the environment when <i>WRspice</i> starts, it is
    expected to contain a path to the <i>WRspice</i> installation area
    or equivalent, which defaults to
    "<tt>/usr/local/xictools/wrspice</tt>".  This overrides <a
    href="XT_PFREFIX"><b>XT_PREFIX</b></a> if that environment
    variable is also found.

    <p>
    There is an important subtlety when using this variable.  Although
    it allows <i>WRspice</i> to find its startup files anywhere, only the
    directory structure implied by <b>XT_PREFIX</b>, that is, for
    <i>WRspice</i>,
    <blockquote>
    <tt>$XT_PREFIX/xictools/wrspice</tt>
    </blockquote>
    is compatible with the program installation script.  The variable
    is perhaps useful for pointing <i>WRspice</i> toward a secondary
    set of startup files, perhaps heavily customized by the user,
    which may reside in an arbitrary location.
    </dl>

    <a name="WRSPICE_FIFO"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>WRSPICE_FIFO</b>
    <dd>
    When <i>WRspice</i> starts, it creates a "named pipe", otherwise
    known as a <a href="fifo">fifo</a>.  Text written to the fifo is
    piped into <i>WRspice</i>, as if input with the <a
    href="source"><b>source</b></a> command.  If this variable is
    found in the environment, the text of this variable is taken as
    the base name for the fifo, instead of "<tt>wrsfifo</tt>".  In
    Unix/Linux, this name can have a full path.  All components of the
    path except for the file name must exist.  If there is a conflict
    with an existing entity, an integer suffix will be added to make
    the name unique.  In Windows, any path given is stripped and
    ignored.
    </dl>

!!IFDEF xtlserv
    <a name="XT_AUTH_MODE"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>XT_AUTH_MODE</b>
    <dd>
    By default, Unix/Linux versions of <i>Xic</i> and <i>WRspice</i>
    use authorization provided by an external license server, possibly
    hosted on a different machine.  On the other hand, the Windows
    versions and <i>XicII</i>/<i>Xiv</i> use built-in authorization. 
    Both the external license server and the programs not using the
    license server make use of a file named "<tt>LICENSE</tt>"
    provided by Whiteley Research, Inc., which provides authorization
    to run on the host computer.

    <p>
    It is possible to run <i>Xic</i> and <i>WRspice</i> without a
    license server, and to run <i>XicII</i>/<i>Xiv</i> from a license
    server.  The status is set with the environment variable
    <b>XT_AUTH_MODE</b>.  This variable has meaning if set to one of
    the keywords "<tt>Server</tt>" or "<tt>Local</tt>"

    <p>
    If set to "<tt>Server</tt>", <i>XicII</i> and <i>Xiv</i> will
    validate through a license server the same way as <i>Xic</i> and
    <i>WRspice</i> normally do.  If set to "<tt>Local</tt>",
    <i>Xic</i> and <i>WRspice</i> will be self-validating the way
    <i>XicII</i> normally is.

    <p>
    <i>Xic</i> and/or <i>WRspice</i> users on a single licensed
    workstation may prefer to set the environment variable in their
    shell startup file and not use the external license server.

    <p>
    When the programs look for the LICENSE file in "<tt>Local</tt>"
    mode, if the file is not found in the startup or license
    directories, the programs will look in the home and current
    directories, in that order, unless <b>XT_LICENSE_PATH</b> is
    also set.
    </dl>

    <a name="XT_LICENSE_PATH"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>XT_LICENSE_PATH</b>
    <dd>
    When using local validation (i.e., not using the license server)
    <b>XT_LICENSE_PATH</b> can be set to the full path to the license
    file.  Only this file will be used - the regular search is
    suppressed.
    </dl>

    <a name="XTLSERVER"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>XTLSERVER</b><dd>
    This provides the host name of the host running the license server
    needed to validate the application.  It is in a format
    understandable to the local name server.  The host name can
    optionally be suffixed by "<tt>:</tt><i>port</i>", where
    <i>port</i> is the port number in use by the server.  There should
    be no space around the colon when using this form.
    </dl>
!!ENDIF

    <a name="XT_PREFIX"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>XT_PREFIX</b><dd>
    All of the <i>XicTools</i> programs respond to the
    <b>XT_PREFIX</b> environment variable.  When the tools are
    installed in a non-standard location, i.e., other than
    <tt>/usr/local</tt>, this can be set to the directory prefix which
    effectively replaces "<tt>/usr/local</tt>", and the programs will
    be able to access the installation library files without further
    directives.  This should not be needed under Windows, as the
    Registry provides the default paths.
    </dl>

    <a name="XT_HOMEDIR"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>XT_HOMEDIR</b><dd>
    Under Windows, the user's "home" directory is determined by
    looking at environment variables.

    <p>
    In Linux, the <b>HOME</b> environment variable is set the the
    user's home directory, and this is also true under Windows if
    using a Linux emulation package such as Cygwin or MSYS.  However,
    in this case <b>HOME</b> will be relative to the file system as
    seen within the emulator, and not the actual Windows file system
    as seen in <i>Xic</i> or <i>WRspice</i> which are Windows-native
    programs.  Therefor, the <b>HOME</b> environment variable is
    ignored under Windows.

    <p>
    Instead, the programs will first look for <b>XT_HOMEDIR</b>.  This
    should be set to the Windows path to the user's MSYS2 or Cygwin
    home directory.  For example, this can be done from the
    <tt>bash_profile</tt> file by adding a line
    <blockquote>
    <tt>export XT_HOMEDIR=c:/msys64/home/</tt><i>yourlogin</i>
    </blockquote>
    Setting this will allow <i>Xic</i> and <i>WRspice</i> to find
    files in the user's MSYS2 home directory, even though the programs
    are Windows native and don't know the MSYS2 paths.

    <p>
    The deprecated <b>XIC_START_DIR</b> variable is checked next, and
    if found its value is taken as the user's home directory in the
    same manner.

    <p>
    If not found, the <b>HOMEDIR</b> and <b>HOMEPATH</b> variables, if
    both are found, are concatenated to yield the home directory path.
    In the unlikely event that these are not set, the
    <b>USERPROFILE</b> variable is checked, and if all else fails,
    "<tt>C:/</tt>" is assumed.  The <b>HOMEDIR</b>/<b>HOMEPATH</b> and
    <b>USERPROFILE</b> variables are set by Windows, at least in some
    Windows versions.

    <p>
    Under other operating systems, the home directory is well-defined
    and is obtained from operating system calls.
    </dl>
   
    <a name="XT_REMOTE_TEST"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>XT_REMOTE_TEST</b>, <b>XTNETDEBUG</b>
    <dd>
    There are two environment variables used for debugging the network
    interfaces.  If the variable <b>XT_REMOTE_TEST</b> is defined,
    <i>Xic</i> will link to <i>WRspice</i> on the local machine
    through the <tt>wrspiced</tt> daemon.  Ordinarily, <i>Xic</i> will
    fork a <i>WRspice</i> process directly on the local machine.  If
    the variable <b>XTNETDEBUG</b> is defined, <i>Xic</i> and
    <i>WRspice</i> will echo interprocess messages sent and received
    to the console.  In server mode, <i>Xic</i> will not go into the
    background, but will remain in the foreground, printing status
    messages while servicing requests.
    </dl>

    <a name="XT_KLU_PATH"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>XT_KLU_PATH</b>
    <dd>
    This can be set to the full path to the KLU (sparse matrix solver)
    plug-in.  For example, this path by default in a Linux installation is
    <blockquote>
    <tt>/usr/local/xictools/wrspice/startup/klu_wr.so</tt>
    </blockquote>
    The plug-in is found automatically so this variable is needed only
    for special cases.

    <p>
    The KLU version changed in wrspice-4.2.7, and the plug-ins are not
    compatible.  Current <i>WRspice</i> releases will not load the old
    plug-in, however older releases will load a new plug-in if found
    in the default location, which will likely cause a program crash. 
    This variable can be set in this case to avoid the problem.
    </dl>

    <a name="XT_LOCAL_MALLOC"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>XT_LOCAL_MALLOC</b>
    <dd>
    Linux and FreeBSD releases can use an included local memory
    allocation package.  In earlier <i>WRspice</i> releases, this
    allocator, rather than the allocator provided by the operating
    system, was used by default.  In 32-bit releases, the local
    allocator was often able to allocate more memory than the
    allocators provided by the operating system.  It also provided
    custom error reporting and statistics.

    <p>
    This feature is now disabled, as in modern operating systems there
    is dubious benefit, and it can produce stability problems in some
    cases.  However, if this variable is set in the environment when
    <i>WRspice</i> is started, the local allocator will be used.  The
    interested user is encouraged to experiment.
    </dl>

    <a name="XT_SYSTEM_MALLOC"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>XT_SYSTEM_MALLOC</b>
    <dd>
    This variable was once used to disable the internal local memory
    allocator, which in earlier releases was enabled by default.
    Currently, this variable is ignored.
    </dl>

    <a name="XT_GUI_COMPACT"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>XT_GUI_COMPACT</b>
    <dd>
    When set, no extra space is allowed around pushbutton contents in
    the graphical interface.  Such space can cause button images to be
    truncated on low-resolution displays if the theme in use imposes
    too much space.  Setting this variable is a quick fix for this
    problem, though one could also change the theme.
    </dl>

    <p>
    There are several environment variables which can be used to alter
    some of the <i>WRspice</i> defaults.  On startup, <i>WRspice</i>
    checks for the following variables in the environment, and alters
    internal defaults accordingly.  The defaults can be modified when
    the program is built, the defaults listed below are those assigned
    in the distribution.

    <a name="HOME"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>HOME</b><dd>
    This is used only in the Microsoft Windows version, and can be set
    to a full directory path which will be taken as the user's home
    directory.
    </dl>

    <a name="DISPLAY"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>DISPLAY</b><dd>
    This variable defines the X window system display that
    <i>WRspice</i> will use, but is ignored if the <a
    href="-d"><tt>-d</tt></a> option is used on the <i>WRspice</i>
    command line.  The display must be specified for <a
    href="graphics">graphics</a> to be enabled in <i>WRspice</i>.
    </dl>

    <a name="EDITOR"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>EDITOR</b><dd>
    If defined to the invoking string for a text editor, that editor
    will be used in the <a href="edit"><b>edit</b></a> command.  This
    is superseded by the <b>SPICE_EDITOR</b> variable, if set.
    </dl>

    <a name="SPICE_EDITOR"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>SPICE_EDITOR</b><dd>
    The text editor called by the <a href="edit"><b>edit</b></a>
    command can be set with this variable.  The variable is defined to
    the command string one would type to invoke the editor.  This will
    supersede the <b>EDITOR</b> variable, if set, but which would
    otherwise have the same effect.  If no editor is specified in the
    environment, or with the <a href="editor"><tt>editor</tt></a>
    shell variable, which supersedes the environment variables, a
    default internal editor is used.  The default internal editor can
    also be specified by setting <b>SPICE_EDITOR</b> to nothing,
    "<tt>default</tt>", or "<tt>xeditor</tt>".
    </dl>

    <a name="TMPDIR"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>TMPDIR</b><dd>
    This specifies a directory to use for temporary files, and is
    superseded by <b>SPICE_TMP_DIR</b>, if defined.  The default
    location if not specified is <tt>/tmp</tt>.
    </dl>

    <a name="SPICE_TMP_DIR"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>SPICE_TMP_DIR</b><dd>
    When <i>WRspice</i> creates a temporary file, it will look for a
    directory named by the <b>SPICE_TMP_DIR</b> environment
    variable, and if not found the directory named in the
    <b>TMPDIR</b> variable, and if still not found the file will be
    created in <tt>/tmp</tt>.
    </dl>

    <a name="SPICE_EXEC_DIR"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>SPICE_EXEC_DIR</b><dd>
    This variable can be used to define the directory containing the
    <i>XicTools</i> binaries, used by the <a
    href="aspice"><b>aspice</b></a> command and the <a
    href="wrspiced"><tt>wrspiced</tt></a> daemon.  If not set, the
    default is "<tt>/usr/local/xictools/bin</tt>", or, if
    <b>XT_PREFIX</b> is set, its value replaces "<tt>/usr/local</tt>".
    </dl>

    <a name="SPICE_PATH"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>SPICE_PATH</b><dd>
    This can be used to set the full path to the <i>WRspice</i>
    executable, for the <a href="aspice"><b>aspice</b></a> command and
    the <a href="wrspiced"><tt>wrspiced</tt></a> daemon.  If not set,
    the default is "<tt>/usr/local/xictools/bin/wrspice</tt>",
    or, if <b>XT_PREFIX</b> is set, its value replaces
    "<tt>/usr/local</tt>".  The <b>SPICE_EXEC_DIR</b> variable can
    also be used for this purpose, unless the <tt>wrspice</tt>
    executable has been renamed.  The <a
    href="spicepath"><tt>spicepath</tt></a> shell variable, if set,
    will override the path set in the environment.  </dl>
    </dl>

    <a name="SPICE_LIB_DIR"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>SPICE_LIB_DIR</b><dd>
    This variable can be used to change the default location where
    <i>WRspice</i> looks for system <a href="startup_files">startup
    files</a>.  If not set, the internal default is
    "<tt>/usr/local/xictools/wrspice/startup</tt>", or, if
    <b>XT_PREFIX</b> is set, its value replaces "<tt>/usr/local</tt>".
    </dl>

    <a name="SPICE_INP_PATH"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>SPICE_INP_PATH</b><dd>
    This can be set to a list of directories to search for input files
    and scripts.  If not set, the internal default is "<tt>( . 
    /usr/local/xictools/wrspice/scripts )</tt>", or, if
    <b>XT_PREFIX</b> is set, its value replaces "<tt>/usr/local</tt>".
    </dl>

    <a name="SPICE_HLP_PATH"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>SPICE_HLP_PATH</b><dd>
    This can be set to a list of directories to search for a
    href="helpsys">help database</a> files.  If not set, the internal
    default is "<tt>( /usr/local/xictools/wrspice/help )</tt>",
    or, if <b>XT_PREFIX</b> is set, its value replaces
    "<tt>/usr/local</tt>".  This is superseded by the <a
    href="helppath"><tt>helppath</tt></a> shell variable, if set.
    </dl>

    <a name="SPICE_NEWS_FILE"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>SPICE_NEWS_FILE</b><dd>
    This variable can be set to the full path to a text file which is
    printed when <i>WRspice</i> starts.  If not set, the file
    <tt>/usr/local/xictools/wrspice/startup/news</tt> will be
    printed, if it exists (if <b>XT_PREFIX</b> is set, its value
    replaces "<tt>/usr/local</tt>").
    </dl>

    <a name="SPICE_BUGADDR"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>SPICE_BUGADDR</b><dd>
    This variable can be set to an internet mail address to use in the
    <a href="bug">bug reporting</a> command.  If not set, the built in
    default is the Whiteley Research technical support address.
    </dl>

    <a name="SPICE_OPTCHAR"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>SPICE_OPTCHAR</b><dd>
    This variable can be defined to a character that will be used to
    flag options on the <i>WRspice</i> <a href="arguments">command
    line</a>.  If not defined, the option character is "-".
    </dl>

    <a name="SPICE_ASCIIRAWFILE"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>SPICE_ASCIIRAWFILE</b><dd>
    If this variable is defined to "0" (zero), or to a word starting
    with 'f' or 'F' such as "False", or 'n' or 'N' such as "No",
    <i>WRspice</i> will create binary plot-data files (rawfiles).  If
    not set or set to something else, <i>WRspice</i> will create the
    default ASCII-format rawfiles.  The <a
    href="filetype"><tt>filetype</tt></a> shell variable can also be
    used to set the mode, which will supersede the environment
    variable.  The rawfiles are normally created with the <a
    href="write"><b>write</b></a> command.
    </dl>

    <a name="SPICE_HOST"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>SPICE_HOST</b><dd>
    This variable can be used to set the host name to use for <a
    href="rspice">remote SPICE</a> runs.  The host name can optionally
    be suffixed by a colon followed by the port number to use for
    communication with the <tt>wrspiced</tt> daemon.  If not given,
    the port is obtained from the operating system for
    "<tt>wrspice/tcp</tt>", or 6114 (the IANA registered port number
    for this service) if this is not defined.  There is no default for
    this variable.  Hosts can also be specified with the <a
    href="rhostcom"><b>rhost</b></a> command, and given with the <a
    href="rhost"><tt>rhost</tt></a> shell variable.
    </dl>

    <a name="SPICE_DAEMONLOG"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>SPICE_DAEMONLOG</b><dd>
    This variable is used by the <a
    href="wrspiced"><tt>wrspiced</tt></a> daemon program to set an
    alternate path for the log file.  The default path is
    <tt>/tmp/wrspiced.log</tt>.
    </dl>

    <a name="SPICENOMAIL"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>SPICENOMAIL</b><dd>
    If the variable <b>SPICENOMAIL</b> is set, no mail will be sent
    during a program crash.  If a fatal error is
    encountered, a file named "<tt>gdbout</tt>" is created in the
    current directory, which contains a stack backtrace from the stack
    frame of the error.  Despite the name, the file is generated
    internally on all platforms, and no longer makes use of the
    <tt>gdb</tt> program.

    <p>
    By default, this file will be emailed to Whiteley Research for
    analysis.  However, the emailing can be suppressed by setting this
    variable in the environment.  The <tt>gdbout</tt> file is produced
    in any case, and would be very useful to Whiteley Research for
    fixing program bugs.
    </dl>

    <a name="XTNOMAIL"></a>
    <dl>

    This has the same effect as <b>SPICENOMAIL</b> but also prevents 
    email from the <i>Xic</i> program.

Environment variables are keyword/value pairs that are made available
to an application by the command shell or operating system.  The value
of an environment variable is a text string, which may be empty. 
Environment variables can be set by the user to control various
defaults in {\WRspice}.

%SU-------------------------------------
\subsection{Unix/Linux}
\index{environment variables!setting}

Environment variables are maintained by the user's command shell.  It
is often convenient to set environment variables in a shell startup
file such as {\vt .cshrc} or {\vt .login} for the C-shell or {\vt
.profile} for the Bourne shell.  These files reside in the user's home
directory.  See the manual page for your shell for more information.

For the C-shell, the command that sets an environment variable is
\begin{quote}
{\vt setenv} {\it variable\_name} [{\it value\/}]
\end{quote}
For example,
\begin{quote}
{\vt setenv XT\_DUMMY "hello world!"}
\end{quote}
Note that if the value contains white space, it should be quoted. 
Note also that it is not necessary to have a value, in which case the
variable acts as a boolean (set or not set).

In the C-shell, one can use {\vt setenv} without arguments, or {\vt
printenv}, to list all of the environment variables currently set.

For a modern Bourne-type shell, such as {\vt bash}, the
corresponding command is
\begin{quote}
{\vt export} {\it variable\_name\/}[={\it value\/}]
\end{quote}
In this type of shell one can list the variables currently set by
giving the shell {\vt set} command with no arguments.

%SU-------------------------------------
\subsection{Microsoft Windows}

Under Windows, environment variables can be set in a DOS box with the
``{\vt set}'' command before starting the program from the command
line, or in the {\vt AUTOEXEC.BAT} file, or from the {\cb System}
entry in the {\cb Control Panel}.  Only the latter two methods work if
the programs are started from an icon.  If using a Cygwin bash-box,
environment variables can be set in the startup file as under Unix.

{\WRspice} is {\bf not} compatible with the {\vt mintty} terminal
emulator which is the current default in Cygwin.  Only Cygwin-built
programs work properly from this terminal if they use a command line
interface.

%SU-------------------------------------
\subsection{{\WRspice} Environment Variables}

The following environment variables are used by all {\XicTools}
programs.

\begin{description}
\index{environment variables!WRSPICE\_HOME}
\item{\et WRSPICE\_HOME}\\
If found in the environment when {\WRspice} starts, it is expected to
contain a path to the {\WRspice} installation area or equivalent,
which defaults to ``{\vt /usr/local/xictools/wrspice}''.  This
overrides {\et XT\_PREFIX} if that environment variable is also found.

There is an important subtlety when using this variable.  Although it
allows {\WRspice} to find its startup files anywhere, only the
directory structure implied by {\et XT\_PREFIX}, that is, for
<i>WRspice</i>,
\begin{quote} \vt
\$XT\_PREFIX/xictools/wrspice
\end{quote}
is compatible with the program installation script.  The variable is
perhaps useful for pointing {\WRspice} toward a secondary set of
startup files, perhaps heavily customized by the user, which may
reside in an arbitrary location.

\index{environment variables!WRSPICE\_FIFO}
\item{\et WRSPICE\_FIFO}\\
When {\WRspice} starts, it creates a ``named pipe'', otherwise known
as a fifo (see \ref{fifo}).  Text written to the fifo is piped into
{\WRspice}, as if input with the {\cb source} command.  If this
variable is found in the environment, the text of this variable is
taken as the base name for the fifo, instead of ``{\vt wrsfifo}''.  In
Unix/Linux, this name can have a full path.  All components of the
path except for the file name must exist.  If there is a conflict with
an existing entity, an integer suffix will be added to make the name
unique.  In Windows, any path given is stripped and ignored.

%\ifxtlserv
%\index{environment variables!XT\_AUTH\_MODE}
%\item{\et XT\_AUTH\_MODE}\\
%By default, Unix/Linux versions of {\Xic} and {\WRspice} use
%authorization provided by an external license server, possibly hosted
%on a different machine.  On the other hand, the Windows versions and
%{\XicII}/{\Xiv} use built-in authorization.  Both the external
%license server and the programs not using the license server make use
%of a file named ``{\vt LICENSE}'' provided by Whiteley Research, Inc.,
%which provides authorization to run on the host computer.
%
%It is possible to run {\Xic} and {\WRspice} without a license server,
%and to run {\XicII}/{\Xiv} from a license server.  The status is set
%with the environment variable {\et XT\_AUTH\_MODE}.  This variable has
%meaning if set to one of the keywords ``{\vt Server}'' or ``{\vt
%Local}''
%
%If set to ``{\vt Server}'', {\XicII} and {\Xiv} will validate through
%a license server the same way as {\Xic} and {\WRspice} normally do. 
%If set to ``{\vt Local}'', {\Xic} and {\WRspice} will be
%self-validating the way {\XicII} normally is.
%
%{\Xic} and/or {\WRspice} users on a single licensed workstation may
%prefer to set the environment variable in their shell startup file and
%not use the external license server.
%
%When the programs look for the LICENSE file in ``{\vt Local}'' mode,
%if the file is not found in the startup or license directories, the
%programs will look in the home and current directories, in that order,
%unless {\et XT\_LICENSE\_PATH} is also set.
%
%\index{environment variables!XT\_LICENSE\_PATH}
%\index{XT\_LICENSE\_PATH environment variable}
%\item{\et XT\_LICENSE\_PATH}\\
%When using local validation (i.e., not using the license server) {\et
%XT\_LICENSE\_PATH} can be set to the full path to the license file. 
%Only this file will be used -- the regular search is suppressed.
%
%\index{environment variables!XTLSERVER}
%\index{XTLSERVER environment variable}
%\item{\et XTLSERVER}\\
%This provides the host name of the host running the license server
%needed to validate the application.  It is in a format understandable
%to the local name server.  The host name can optionally be suffixed by
%``{\vt :}{\it port\/}'', where {\it port} is the port number in use by
%the server.  There should be no space around the colon when using this
%form.
%\fi

\index{environment variables!XT\_PREFIX}
\index{XT\_PREFIX environment variable}
\item{\et XT\_PREFIX}\\
All of the {\XicTools} programs respond to the {\et XT\_PREFIX}
environment variable.  When the tools are installed in a non-standard
location, i.e., other than {\vt /usr/local}, this can be set to the
directory prefix which effectively replaces ``{\vt /usr/local}'', and
the programs will be able to access the installation library files
without further directives.  This should not be needed under Windows,
as the Registry provides the default paths.

\index{environment variables!XT\_HOMEDIR}
\index{XT\_HOMEDIR environment variable}
\item{\et XT\_HOMEDIR}\\
Under Windows, the user's ``home'' directory is determined by looking
at environment variables.

In Linux, the {\et HOME} environment variable is set the the user's home
directory, and this is also true under Windows if using a Linux emulation
package such as Cygwin or MSYS.  However, in this case {\et HOME} will be
relative to the file system as seen within the emulator, and not the
actual Windows file system as seen in {\Xic} or {\WRspice} which are
Windows-native programs.  Therefor, the {\et HOME} environment variable
is ignored under Windows.

Instead, the programs will first look for {\et XT\_HOMEDIR}.  This
should be set to the Windows path to the user's MSYS2 or Cygwin home  
directory.  For example, this can be done from the {\vt bash\_profile}
file by adding a line
\begin{quote}
{\vt export XT\_HOMEDIR=c:/msys64/home/}{\it yourlogin}
\end{quote}
Setting this will allow {\Xic} and {\WRspice} to find files in the
user's MSYS2 home directory, even though the programs are Windows
native and don't know the MSYS2 paths.

The deprecated {\et XIC\_START\_DIR} variable is checked next, and if
found its value is taken as the user's home directory in the same
manner.

If not found, the {\et HOMEDIR} and {\et HOMEPATH}
variables, if both are found, are concatenated to yield the home
directory path.  In the unlikely event that these are not set, the
{\et USERPROFILE} variable is checked, and if all else fails, ``{\vt
C:$\backslash$}'' is assumed.  The {\et HOMEDIR}/{\et HOMEPATH} and
{\et USERPROFILE} variables are set by Windows, at least in some
Windows versions.

Under other operating systems, the home directory is well-defined
and is obtained from operating system calls.

\index{environment!XTNETDEBUG}
\index{XTNETDEBUG environment variable}
\item{\et XTNETDEBUG}\\
If the variable {\et XTNETDEBUG} is defined, {\Xic} and {\WRspice}
will echo interprocess messages sent and received to the console.  In
server mode, {\Xic} will not go into the background, but will remain
in the foreground, printing status messages while servicing requests.

\index{environment!XT\_KLU\_PATH}
\index{XT\_KLU\_PATH environment variable}
\item{\et XT\_KLU\_PATH}\\
This can be set to the full path to the KLU (sparse matrix solver)
plug-in.  For example, this path by default in a Linux installation is
\begin{quote}\vt
/usr/local/xictools/wrspice/startup/klu\_wr.so
\end{quote}
The plug-in is found automatically so this variable is needed only for
special cases. 

The KLU version changed in wrspice-4.2.7, and the plug-ins are not
compatible.  Current {\WRspice} releases will not load the old
plug-in, however older releases will load a new plug-in if found in
the default location, which will likely cause a program crash.  This
variable can be set in this case to avoid the problem.

\index{memory management}
\index{environment variables!XT\_LOCAL\_MALLOC}
\index{XT\_LOCAL\_MALLOC environment variable}
\item{\et XT\_LOCAL\_MALLOC}\\
Linux and FreeBSD releases can use an included local memory allocation
package.  In earlier {\WRspice} releases, this allocator, rather than
the allocator provided by the operating system, was used by default. 
In 32--bit releases, the local allocator was often able to allocate
more memory than the allocators provided by the operating system.  It
also provided custom error reporting and statistics.

This feature is now disabled, as in modern operating systems there is
dubious benefit, and it can produce stability problems in some cases. 
However, if this variable is set in the environment when {\WRspice} is
started, the local allocator will be used.  The interested user is
encouraged to experiment.

\index{environment variables!XT\_SYSTEM\_MALLOC}
\index{XT\_SYSTEM\_MALLOC environment variable}
\item{\et XT\_SYSTEM\_MALLOC}\\
This variable was once used to disable the internal local memory
allocator, which in earlier releases was enabled by default. 
Currently, this variable is ignored.

\index{environment!XT\_GUI\_COMPACT}
\index{XT\_GUI\_COMPACT environment variable}
\item{\et XT\_GUI\_COMPACT}\\
When set, no extra space is allowed around pushbutton contents in the
graphical interface.  Such space can cause menu button images to
be truncated on low-resolution displays if the theme in use imposes
too much space.  Setting this variable is a quick fix for this
problem, though one could also change the theme.
\end{description}

There are several environment variables which can be used to alter
some of the {\WRspice} defaults.  On startup, {\WRspice} checks for the
following variables in the environment, and alters internal defaults
accordingly.  The defaults can be modified when the program is built,
the defaults listed below are those assigned in the distribution.

\begin{description}
\raggedright
\index{environment variables!HOME}
\index{HOME environment variable}
\item{\et HOME}\\
This is used only in the Microsoft Windows version, and can be set to
a full directory path which will be taken as the user's home
directory.

\index{environment variables!DISPLAY}
\index{DISPLAY environment variable}
\item{\et DISPLAY}\\
This variable defines the X window system display that {\WRspice} will
use, but is ignored if the {\vt -d} option is used on the {\WRspice}
command line.  The display must be specified for graphics to be
enabled in {\WRspice}.

\index{environment variables!EDITOR}
\index{EDITOR environment variable}
\item{\et EDITOR}\\
If defined to the invoking string for a text editor, that editor will
be used in the {\cb edit} command.  This is superseded by the {\et
SPICE\_EDITOR} variable, if set.

\index{SPICE\_EDITOR environment variable}
\index{environment variables!SPICE\_EDITOR}
\item{\et SPICE\_EDITOR}\\
The text editor called by the {\cb edit} command can be set with this
variable.  The variable is defined to the command string one would
type to invoke the editor.  This will supersede the {\et EDITOR}
variable, if set, but which would otherwise have the same effect.  If
no editor is specified in the environment, or with the {\et editor}
shell variable, which supersedes the environment variables, a default
internal editor is used.  The default internal editor can also be
specified by setting {\et SPICE\_EDITOR} to nothing, ``{\vt default}'',
or ``{\vt xeditor}''.

\index{environment variables!TMPDIR}
\index{TMPDIR environment variable}
\item{\et TMPDIR}\\
This specifies a directory to use for temporary files, and is
superseded by {\et SPICE\_TMP\_DIR}, if defined.  The default location
if not specified is {\vt /tmp}.

\index{environment variables!SPICE\_TMP\_DIR}
\index{SPICE\_TMP\_DIR environment variable}
\item{\et SPICE\_TMP\_DIR}\\
When {\WRspice} creates a temporary file, it will look for a directory named
by the {\et SPICE\_TMP\_DIR} environment variable, and if not found the
directory named in the {\et TMPDIR} variable, and if still not found
the file will be created in {\vt /tmp}.

\index{environment variables!SPICE\_EXEC\_DIR}
\index{SPICE\_EXEC\_DIR environment variable}
\item{\et SPICE\_EXEC\_DIR}\\
This variable can be used to define the directory containing the
{\XicTools} binaries, used by the {\cb aspice} command and the {\vt
wrspiced} daemon.  If not set, the default is ``{\vt
/usr/local/xictools/bin}'', or, if {\vt XT\_PREFIX} is set, its
value replaces ``{\vt /usr/local}''.

\index{environment variables!SPICE\_PATH}
\index{SPICE\_PATH environment variable}
\item{\et SPICE\_PATH}\\
This can be used to set the full path to the {\WRspice} executable,
for the {\cb aspice} command and the {\vt wrspiced} daemon.  If not
set, the default is ``{\vt /usr/local/xictools/bin/wrspice}'',
or, if {\et XT\_PREFIX} is set, its value replaces ``{\vt
/usr/local}''.  The {\et SPICE\_EXEC\_DIR} variable can also be used
for this purpose, unless the {\vt wrspice} executable has been
renamed.  The {\et spicepath} shell variable, if set, will override
the path set in the environment.

\index{environment variables!SPICE\_LIB\_DIR}
\index{SPICE\_LIB\_DIR environment variable}
\item{\et SPICE\_LIB\_DIR}\\
This variable can be used to change the default location where
{\WRspice} looks for system startup files.  If not set, the internal
default is ``{\vt /usr/local/xictools/wrspice/startup}'', or, if
{\vt XT\_PREFIX} is set, its value replaces ``{\vt /usr/local}''.

\index{environment variables!SPICE\_INP\_PATH}
\index{SPICE\_INP\_PATH environment variable}
\item{\et SPICE\_INP\_PATH}\\
This can be set to a list of directories to search for input files and
scripts.  If not set, the internal default is ``{\vt ( . 
/usr/local/xictools/wrspice/scripts )}'', or, if {\et XT\_PREFIX}
is set, its value replaces ``{\vt /usr/local}''.

\index{environment variables!SPICE\_HLP\_PATH}
\index{SPICE\_HLP\_PATH environment variable}
\item{\et SPICE\_HLP\_PATH}\\
This can be set to a list of directories to search for help database
files.  If not set, the internal default is ``{\vt (
/usr/local/xictools/wrspice/help )}'', or, if {\et XT\_PREFIX} is
set, its value replaces ``{\vt /usr/local}''.  This is superseded by
the {\et helppath} shell variable, if set.

\index{environment variables!SPICE\_NEWS\_FILE}
\index{SPICE\_NEWS\_FILE environment variable}
\item{\et SPICE\_NEWS\_FILE}\\
This variable can be set to the full path to a text file which is
printed when {\WRspice} starts.  If not set, the file {\vt
/usr/local/xictools/wrspice/startup/news} will be printed, if it
exists (if {\et XT\_PREFIX} is set, its value replaces ``{\vt
/usr/local}'').

\index{environment variables!SPICE\_BUGADDR}
\index{SPICE\_BUGADDR environment variable}
\item{\et SPICE\_BUGADDR}\\
This variable can be set to an internet mail address to use in the bug
reporting command.  If not set, the built in default is the Whiteley
Research technical support address.

\index{environment variables!SPICE\_OPTCHAR}
\index{SPICE\_OPTCHAR environment variable}
\item{\et SPICE\_OPTCHAR}\\
This variable can be defined to a character that will be used to flag
options on the {\WRspice} command line.  If not defined, the option
character is ``$-$''.

\index{environment variables!SPICE\_ASCIIRAWFILE}
\index{SPICE\_ASCIIRAWFILE environment variable}
\item{\et SPICE\_ASCIIRAWFILE}\\
If this variable is defined to ``0'' (zero), or to a word starting
with `{\vt f}' or `{\vt F}' such as ``{\vt False}'', or `{\vt n}' or
`{\vt N}' such as ``{\vt No}'', {\WRspice} will create binary
plot-data files (rawfiles).  If not set or set to something else,
{\WRspice} will create the default ASCII-format rawfiles.  The {\et
filetype} shell variable can also be used to set the mode, which will
supersede the environment variable.  The rawfiles are normally created
with the {\cb write} command.

\index{environment variables!SPICE\_HOST}
\index{SPICE\_HOST environment variable}
\item{\et SPICE\_HOST}\\
This variable can be used to set the host name to use for remote SPICE
runs.  The host name can optionally be suffixed by a colon followed by
the port number to use for communication with the {\vt wrspiced}
daemon.  If not given, the port is obtained from the operating system
for ``{\vt wrspice/tcp}'', or 6114 (the IANA registered port number
for this service) if this is not defined.  There is no default for
this variable.  Hosts can also be specified with the {\cb rhost}
command, and given with the {\et rhost} shell variable.

\index{environment variables!SPICE\_DAEMONLOG}
\index{SPICE\_DAEMONLOG environment variable}
\item{\et SPICE\_DAEMONLOG}\\
This variable is used by the {\vt wrspiced} daemon program to set an
alternate path for the log file.  The default path is {\vt
/tmp/wrspiced.log}.

\index{environment variables!SPICENOMAIL}
\index{SPICENOMAIL environment variable}
\item{\et SPICENOMAIL}\\
If the variable {\et SPICENOMAIL} is set, no mail will be sent during
a program crash.  If a fatal error is encountered, a file named ``{\vt
gdbout}'' is created in the current directory, which contains a stack
backtrace from the stack frame of the error.  Despite the name, the
file is generated internally on all platforms, and no longer makes use
of the {\vt gdb} program.

By default, this file will be emailed to Whiteley Research for
analysis.  However, the emailing can be suppressed by setting this
variable in the environment.  The {\vt gdbout} file is produced in any
case, and would be very useful to Whiteley Research for fixing program
bugs.

\index{environment variables!XTNOMAIL}
\index{XTNOMAIL environment variable}
\item{\et XTNOMAIL}\\
This has the same effect as {\et SPICENOMAIL} but also prevents email
from the {\Xic} program.

    Prior releases of <i>WRspice</i> could be configured to check for
    the availability of program updates on startup.  There was also
    provision for display of a message if one was "broadcast" from the
    Whiteley Research web site.  This latter feature was never used,
    and neither feature is currently supported in <i>WRspice</i>. 
    Thus, there is no longer a network access attempt on program
    startup, which may save time.
    
    <p>
    Program <a href="update">updates</a> are handled in the <a
    href="helpsys">help system</a>, for all of the <i>XicTools</i>
    packages.  Either the help system built into <i>Xic</i> and
    <i>WRspice</i>, or the stand-alone <i>mozy</i> program can be used
    to check for, download, and install updates.  Giving the keyword
    "<tt>:xt_pkgs</tt>" will display a page that provides update
    information and download/install buttons.
    
    <p>
    If a new <i>WRspice</i> release is run for the first time, the
    release notes will appear in a pop-up window, as if the
    <b>Notes</b> button in the <b>Help</b> menu was pressed.  There is
    a file in the user's <tt>.wr_cache</tt> directory named
    "<tt>wrspice_current_release</tt>" that contains a release number. 
    If, when <i>WRspice</i> starts, this file is missing or the
    release number is not current, <i>WRspice</i> will show the
    release notes and update the file.  If the release numbers match,
    there is no action.

    <p>
    <i>WRspice</i> will attempt to source startup files used for
    initialization when the program is started.  First, a file named
    <tt>wrspiceinit</tt> is searched for in the system startup
    directory, and if found is sourced into <i>WRspice</i>.  The
    system startup directory has a default location built into the
    program (<tt>/usr/local/xictools/wrspice/startup</tt>, or if
    <b>XT_PREFIX</b> is set in the <a
    href="environment">environment</a>, its value replaces
    "<tt>/usr/local</tt>"), but this can be changed by setting the
    <b>SPICE_LIB_DIR</b> environment variable to another location.

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>license.host</tt> file<dd>
    When using a license server on a remote machine, it is necessary
    to provide the name of this machine or <i>WRspice</i> can not run.
    One way to do this is to create a <tt>license.host</tt> file in
    the startup directory, e.g.
    <tt>/usr/local/xictools/wrspice/startup</tt>.  The
    <tt>license.host</tt> file consists of a single line of text,
    giving the host name of the license server machine.  The host
    name can optionally be suffixed with "<tt>:</tt><i>port</i>", where
    <i>port</i> is the port number in use by the license server.  This
    is required if for some reason the license server is not running
    on the default port.
    </dl>
!!ENDIF

    <a name="wrspiceinit"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>.wrspiceinit</tt> file<dd>
    Files named "<tt>.wrspiceinit</tt>" are searched for in the user's
    home directory, and the current directory, and are sourced, if
    found, in that order.  If running on Microsoft Windows which does
    not support the notion of a home directory, <i>WRspice</i> will
    look in the environment for a variable named "<b>HOME</b>", and
    its value will be taken as the path to the "home directory".  If
    not set, the search is skipped.

    <p>
    These files have identical format, and contain ordinary script
    commands, which can be used to set the default behavior of
    <i>WRspice</i>.  The first line is ignored, but all remaining
    lines are taken as script commands.  The special directive <a
    href="tbsetup"><b>tbsetup</b></a>, which can only appear in these
    files, provides the setup information for the graphical interface. 
    Unlike ordinary input files, it is not necessary to enclose the
    commands in <a href=".exec"><tt>.control</tt> or
    <tt>.exec</tt></a> blocks in the startup files.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt>X Resources<dd>
    When using the X window system, the X resource-passing mechanism
    can be used to set the default colors used in plots.  The resource
    mechanism is otherwise ignored in the current version of
    <i>WRspice</i>.  The base names for the color resources are
    "<tt>color0</tt>" through "<tt>color19</tt>", with the
    corresponding class names capitalized.  Thus, one way to define
    alternative plotting colors is to create a file named
    "<tt>Wrspice</tt>" in the user's home directory, which contains
    lines like
    <blockquote>
    <tt>*color2: red</tt>
    </blockquote>
    for each new color definition.  The color name should be known to
    the X window system, i.e., be listed in the <tt>rgb.txt</tt> file
    in the X-windows system library.

    <p>
    The same definitions could be placed in a <tt>.wrspiceinit</tt>
    file with lines like "<tt>set color2 = red</tt>".

!!LATEX startup_files useriface.tex
Prior releases of {\WRspice} could be configured to check for the
availability of program updates on startup.  There was also provision
for display of a message if one was ``broadcast'' from the Whiteley
Research web site.  This latter feature was never used, and neither
feature is currently supported in {\WRspice}.  Thus, there is no
longer a network access attempt on program startup, which may save
time.

Program updates are handled in the help system (see \ref{update}),
for all of the {\XicTools} packages.  Either the help system built
into {\Xic} and {\WRspice}, or the stand-alone {\it mozy} program can
be used to check for, download, and install updates.  Giving the
keyword ``{\vt :xt\_pkgs}'' will display a page that provides update
information and download/install buttons.

If a new {\WRspice} release is run for the first time, the
release notes will appear in a pop-up window, as if the {\cb Notes}
button in the {\cb Help} menu was pressed.  There is a file in the
user's {\vt .wr\_cache} directory named ``{\vt
wrspice\_current\_release}'' that contains a release number.  If, when
{\WRspice} starts, this file is missing or the release number is not
current, {\WRspice} will show the release notes and update the file. 
If the release numbers match, there is no action.

\index{wrspiceinit file}
{\WRspice} will attempt to source startup files used for
initialization when the program is started.  First, a file named
``{\vt wrspiceinit}'' is searched for in the system startup directory,
and if found is sourced into {\WRspice}.  The system startup directory
has a default location built into the program\\
({\vt /usr/local/xictools/wrspice/startup}, or if {\et XT\_PREFIX}
is set in the environment, its value replaces ``{\vt /usr/local}''),
but this can be changed by setting the {\et SPICE\_LIB\_DIR}
environment variable to another location.

%\index{license.host file}
%\item{{\vt license.host} file}\\
%When using a license server on a remote machine, it is necessary to
%provide the name of this machine or {\WRspice} can not run.  One way
%to do this is to create a {\vt license.host} file in the startup
%directory, e.g. {\vt /usr/local/xictools/wrspice/startup}.  The
%{\vt license.host} file consists of a single line of text, giving the
%host name of the license server machine.  The host name can optionally
%be suffixed with ``{\vt :}{\it port\/}'', where {\it port} is the port
%number in use by the license server.  This is required if for some
%reason the license server is not running on the default port.
%\fi

\index{.wrspiceinit file}
\item{{\vt .wrspiceinit} file}\\
Files named ``{\vt .wrspiceinit}'' are searched for in the user's home
directory, and the current directory, and are sourced, if found, in
that order.  If running on Microsoft Windows which does not support
the notion of a home directory, {\WRspice} will look in the
environment for a variable named ``{\et HOME}'', and its value will be
taken as the path to the "home directory".  If not set, the search is
skipped.

These files have identical format, and contain ordinary script
commands, which can be used to set the default behavior of {\WRspice}. 
The first line is ignored, but all remaining lines are taken as script
commands.  The special directive {\vt tbsetup}, which can only appear
in these files, provides the setup information for the graphical
interface.  Unlike ordinary input files, it is not necessary to
enclose the commands in {\vt .control} or {\vt .exec} blocks in the
startup files.

\index{X resources}
\index{colors, setting}
\item{X Resources}\\
When using the X-window system, the X resource-passing mechanism can
be used to set the default colors used in plots.  The resource
mechanism is otherwise ignored in the current version of {\WRspice}. 
The base names for the color resources are ``{\vt color0}'' through
``{\vt color19}'', with the corresponding class names capitalized. 
Thus, one way to define alternative plotting colors is to create a
file named ``{\vt Wrspice}'' in the user's home directory, which
contains lines like
\begin{quote}\vt
*color2: red
\end{quote}
for each new color definition.  The color name should be known to the
X window system, i.e., be listed in the {\vt rgb.txt} file in the
X-windows system library.

The same definitions could be placed in a {\vt .wrspiceinit} file with
lines like ``{\vt set color2 = red}''.

    This command can appear in the <a href="startup_files">startup
    files</a> only.  It is inserted into or updated in the
    <tt>.wrspiceinit</tt> file in the user's home directory in
    response to the <a href="tbupdate"><b>tbupdate</b></a> command, or
    from pressing the <b>Save Tools</b> button in the <b>File</b>
    menu of the <a href="toolbar"><b>Tool Control</b></a> window.  It
    is not likely that the user will need to work with <b>tbsetup</b>
    directly, though it can be used to customize the <b>Tools</b> menu
    in the <b>Tool Control</b> window.

    <p>
    The command string takes the following form:
    <blockquote>
    <tt>tbsetup</tt> [<tt>old</tt>] [<tt>vert</tt>] [<tt>toolbar on|off</tt>
     <i>x y</i>]
     [<i>name1</i> <tt>on|off</tt> <i>x y</i>] [<i>name2</i> ...
    </blockquote>
    The <tt>old</tt> and <tt>vert</tt> keywords are ignored.  They
    exist for backward compatibility.

    <p>
    By invoking the <b>tbupdate</b> command from the prompt line or
    pressing the <b>Save Tools</b> button in the <b>File</b> menu of
    the <b>Tool Control</b> window, a <tt>.wrspiceinit</tt> file is
    created in the user's home directory if necessary, and the
    <b>tbsetup</b> command will be added or updated.  This will save
    the current state of the windows from the <b>Tools</b> menu, which
    will be recreated when the program is started the next time.

    <p>
    If no <b>tbsetup</b> command is found on program startup, a
    default configuration is used (all tools initially invisible).

    <p>
    For each argument block in the <b>tbsetup</b> call, the first
    token gives the tool name, with the "<tt>toolbar</tt>" entry
    indicating the <b>Tool Control</b> window itself.  For other than
    the <b>Tool Control</b> window, which is always shown, the
    <tt>on</tt> and <tt>off</tt> keywords specify whether the tools
    are shown at startup.  The two numbers that follow give the
    position of the upper left corner of the tool on the screen (the
    screen origin is the upper left corner, coordinates are in
    pixels).  For other than the first (<b>Tool Control</b> window)
    entry, the blocks can be rearranged or deleted.  The <b>Tools</b>
    menu will show only the tools listed, in the order given.  Thus,
    the <b>Tools</b> menu can be customized.

    <p>
    To generate an initial custom configuration, simply start
    <i>WRspice</i> on a system that supports graphics, and the <b>Tool
    Control</b> window will appear somewhere on-screen.  After opening
    some of the tools from the <b>Tools</b> menu and arranging them as
    necessary and/or moving the <b>Tool Control</b> window, the
    <b>Save Tools</b> button in the <b>File</b> menu can be pressed. 
    A <tt>.wrspiceinit</tt> file will be created, or an existing file
    updated, in the user's home directory.  Alternatively, the
    <b>tbupdate</b> command can be given from the command line.  Hand
    editing of the <tt>.wrspiceinit</tt> file may be used to remove
    buttons or change the button order in the <b>Tools</b> menu.  Once
    edited, only the tools present will be updated.
