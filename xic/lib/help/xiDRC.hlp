Design Rule Checking
!!HTML
    The <b>DRC Menu</b> contains commands which control checking of <a
    href="drcrules">design rules</a>.  The menu is accessible only in
    physical mode, and design rule checking can only be applied in
    physical mode.  <i>Xic</i> has the capability of checking for
    design rule violations as any object is created or modified, and
    for checking regions and cells interactively or in batch mode. 
    The algorithm fully supports non-Manhattan geometry.  Design rules
    are provided in the <a href="techfile">technology file</a>, or
    interactively using the <a href="xic:dredt"><b>Edit Rules</b></a>
    command.

    <p>
    The table below lists the commands found in the <b>DRC Menu</b>,
    and supplies the internal command name and a brief description.

    After a check is performed, violating objects are shown on-screen
    with the border highlighted, and a highlighting border is drawn
    around the test region containing the error.  These objects are
    <i>not</i> removed from the database.  It is up to the user to fix
    or ignore errors as they are indicated.

    <p>
    Presently, the indication of a violation is not saved as the cell
    is written.

    <p>
    Design rules are specified in the technology file, or with the
    <b>Design Rule Editor</b> made visible with the <b>Edit Rules</b>
    button in the <b>DRC Menu</b>.  The rules are specified by a
    keyword, followed by an optional source region specification,
    followed by parameters.  In addition to the built-in rule
    primitives to be described, a capability exists for users to
    define specialized or more complex tests.

    <p>
    <i>Xic</i> provides a number of internal rule evaluation
    functions, to be described in this section.  These should cover
    basic and common design rules as published for a particular
    fabrication process.  More complex rules can perhaps be
    accommodated with the <a href="userrules">user-defined</a> rule
    capability.

    <p>
    Design rules are associated with <i>Xic</i> physical and <a
    href="drvlayer">derived</a> layers.  In the technology file, the
    rule definitions appear in layer blocks for physical and derived
    layers.

    <p>
    The rules, and derived layers, make use of <a
    href="layer_exp">layer expressions</a>.  A layer expression can be
    a single layer name, or a more complicated expression involving
    other normal and derived layer names.  In a rule specification,
    the expression syntactically represents a single token, though the
    expression may include white space.  The expression in the
    specification is parsed as far as possible (white space is
    ignored), and the rest of the line is taken as further input to
    the specification.

    <p>
    The result of the evaluation of a layer expression can be thought
    of as a set of geometric figures representing areas where the
    expression is true.  Below are two example rule specifications
    that use layer expressions.

    <blockquote><tt>
      Overlap M1 | M2  #layer must be covered by M1 or M2<br>
      NoOverlap Via&!M1 #layer can't overlap Via without M1
    </tt></blockquote>

    <p>
    Where a layer expression can be used, a derived layer can also be
    used.  The examples above can be expressed alternatively using
    derived layers.

    <blockquote><tt>
    DerivedLayer m1orm2 M1 | M2<br>
    DerivedLayer vianotm1 Via&!M1<br>
    ...<br>
    Overlap m1orm2  #layer must be covered by M1 or M2<br>
    NoOverlap vianotm1 #layer can't overlap Via without M1
    </tt></blockquote>

    Whether it is "better" to use layer expressions or derived layers
    in the rules is still a bit open, as derived layers are a new
    feature.  There may be performance differences, as evaluation is
    quite different.  In the case of derived layers, all geometry on
    the derived layers is computed before a DRC run, and cleared after
    the run.  Thus, during rule evaluation, existing geometry is
    simply accessed.  When a layer expression is used, the expression
    is evaluated in test regions while the rule is being evaluated. 
    Thus, the expression requires evauation, over a tiny area, many
    times.  It is not clear that one method or the other would be
    generally faster, users should experiment.  Use of layer
    expressions may be preferred if memory is constraining, as the
    amount of memory required to save derived layer geometry may be
    substantial.

    <p>
    Use of derived layers may be required for certain types of rules.
    For example, suppose that we have a constraint:

    <blockquote><tt>
    (NP or PP) Enclosure of PO 0.15
    </tt></blockquote>

    What this means is that layers NP or PP must cover layer PO, with
    0.15 microns distance surrounding PO covered by NP or PP.  This
    translates directly to the <tt>MinNoOverlap</tt> rule, but applied
    on the layer combination NP|PP, which can be accomplished with a
    derived layer.

    <blockquote><tt>
    DerivedLayer implant NP|PP<br>
    MinNoOverlap PO 0.15 # (NP or PP) Enclosure of PO 0.15
    </tt></blockquote>

    <p>
    Ordinarily, a design rule evaluation proceeds as follows.  All
    evaluation is performed using a "pseudo-flat" representation of
    the cell hierarchy, which effectively translates the coordinates
    of every object in the hierarchy to the space of the top-level
    cell.  Each object in this space can be tested without having to
    know which cell in the hierarchy actually contains the object. 
    The "global" tests, that are not associated with individual
    objects, such as checking for holes, are done first.  Then, the
    per-object tests are performed on each object in the pseudo-flat
    representation.  For each object (box, polygon, or wire), each
    test listed for the layer of the object is run in sequence.  The
    per-area tests, which are done first, are applied to the area of
    the object, and the remaining tests are applied to constructed
    regions along each edge of the object.

    <p>
    Below are descriptions of the built-in design rule test functions,
    and the syntax used to specify the test in a layer block in the
    technology file.  Each rule line starts with the defining keyword,
    followed by an optional <tt>Region</tt> expression, required
    parameters, and an optional explanation string.

    <p>
    If the <tt>Region</tt> keyword and associated expression are given
    in the rule specification, the source area becomes those regions
    where the expression is true, within the boundaries of the object. 
    The per-area tests are applied to the areas where the expression
    is true, and the other tests are applied to the edges of these
    regions.  In simple cases, the <tt>Region</tt> expression is not
    necessary, but it does provide additional capability for more
    complex testing.

    <p>
    Use of <tt>Region</tt> is very similar to defining the rule on a
    derived layer consisting of the original layer ANDed with the
    <tt>Region</tt> expression.

    <p>
    An optional descriptive string can follow the rule specification.
    This string will be saved and included in violation reports.
    It is a good idea start the explanation string (if any) with the
    script comment character '#' to guarantee termination of the
    preceding expression.  Recall that white space is ignored when
    parsing the expression.  Most of the time, the parser can
    recognize the end of the expression, so the comment character is
    not necessary, but it is possible that the explanation string
    might start with an operator token such as '*' or a reserved
    keyword such as "<tt>not</tt>", and the expression parse would
    fail.

    <p>
    For certain rules, the description may have multiple components,
    i.e., it actually consists of multiple strings.  This syntax will
    be described below for the affected rules, but is amounts to
    simply double-quoting the individual strings.  When constraints
    are imported from a Virtuoso ASCII technology file, there are
    occasions where multiple constraints, each with a description
    string, map to a single <i>Xic</i> primitive rule.  These strings
    will be recovered when converting back to Virtuoso format with the
    <a href="!dumpcds"><b>!dumpcds</b></a> command.

    <p>
    In the discussion that follows, the following definitions will be
    used.  An "object" is a physical entity found in the database.  A
    "figure" is a geometrical shape and an associated layer expression
    which is true within the shape.  A figure can represent an object
    and the object's layer, for example, or one of the regions where a
    layer expression is true, and the layer expression.  The "source"
    is a set of figures where rule evaluation is to be performed.  If
    no <tt>Region</tt> is given, the source is simply the figure
    representing the object's geometry and the object's layer. 
    Otherwise, the source is the set of figures where the region
    expression is true within the object.  Two or more figures are
    "compatible" if they are associated with the same layer
    expression.

    <a name="glob"></a>
    <h2>Global Rules</h2>

    The first two rules operate differently from the others, in that
    they do not operate on a per-object basis, rather they operate on
    an entire pseudo-flattened layer.  As such, they can be
    computationally and memory intensive.  These "global" tests are
    performed before the others, however they are performed only if
    the area being checked is the entire cell area.

    <a name="Connected"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>Connected</b>
    <dd>Syntax: <tt>Connected [Region</tt> <i>region_expr</i><tt>]</tt>
        [<i>string</i>]<br>

    <p>
    If given in the layer block, the layer or region description
    (which is applied to the whole layer) is tested to see that all
    figures are mutually connected (touch or overlap).  Disjoint
    groups of figures are flagged as violations in the top level cell. 
    The group with the largest area is assumed to be the "correct"
    group.
    </dl>

    <a name="NoHoles"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>NoHoles</b>
    <dd>Syntax: <tt>NoHoles</tt> [<tt>Region</tt> <i>region_expr</i>]
        [<tt>MinArea</tt> <i>area</i>] [<tt>MinWidth</tt> <i>width</i>]
        [<i>string</i>]<br>

    <p>
    If given in the layer block, the layer or region description
    (which is applied to the whole layer) is tested for clear area
    surrounded by dark area.  Each such area is optionally tested.  If
    the <tt>MinArea</tt> is given and positive and the clear area is
    smaller, a violation will be reported.  If the <tt>MinWidth</tt>
    is given and positive, the clear area must be large enough so that
    for any edge, a rectangular projection along the edge extending
    into the interior by the given width will be clear.  If not, a
    violation will be reported.  If neither of the <tt>MinArea</tt> or
    <tt>MinWidth</tt> are given, then any such clear area found will
    be flagged as a violation.

    <p>
    The <tt>MinArea</tt> and <tt>MinWidth</tt> clauses are set by the
    <tt>minHoleArea</tt> and <tt>minHoleWidth</tt> constraints when
    importing Virtuoso technology data.  Each constraint may have a
    separate reference string.  To keep these distinguishable, the
    <i>string</i> can actually be three double quoted strings, e.g.,
    the form is

    <blockquote><tt>
    "# rule description" "minHoleArea string" "minHoleWidth string"
    </tt></blockquote>

    This guarantees that the original reference strings are
    regenerated when the <a href="!dumpcds"><b>!dumpcds</b></a>
    command is used to generate a Virtuoso technology file.  If a
    component string doesn't exist, one can use "" (two double-quote
    marks) as a placeholder.  Strings to the right that don't exist
    can be skipped entirely.
    </dl>

    <a name="area"></a>
    <h2>Area Rules</h2>

    The following are the per-area tests, and are applied to the area
    of each source figure, for each object in the pseudo-flat
    representation.

    <a name="Exist"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>Exist</b>
    <dd>Syntax: <tt>Exist</tt> [<i>string</i>]<br>

    <p>
    This rule will indicate a violation if any dark area is found on
    the layer containing the rule.  Unlike most if not all other rules,
    no <tt>Region</tt> specification is allowed.

    <p>
    The <tt>Exist</tt> rule is intended for <a href="drvlayer">derived
    layers</a> whose construction would indicate an incorrect
    combination of other layers (normal and derived).  Layer
    expressions and derived layers can be used as alternatives to many
    of the built in rules, and for formulating new rules.  The results
    are a bit different from the per-object and per-edge
    iteration of the normal rule evaluation flow.  All violations are
    found as objects on the derived layer, there is no search limit
    (e.g., the normal flow may limit reporting to one violation per
    object, though an object may be associated with multiple
    violations).  The approach gives the rule-author flexibility.
    </dl>

    <a name="Overlap"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>Overlap</b>
    <dd>Syntax: <tt>Overlap [Region</tt> <i>region_expr</i><tt>]</tt>
        <i>expression</i> [<i>string</i>]<br>

    <img src="overlap.gif"><br>
    This test fails if any source figure is not completely covered by
    the figures associated with the <i>expression</i>.  In other
    words, for the situation where no <tt>Region</tt> is given, the
    <i>expression</i> must evaluate true at every point of every
    object on the present layer.  This is illustrated in the figure
    for no <tt>Region</tt> and an expression consisting of a single
    layer.
    </dl>
    
    <a name="IfOverlap"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>IfOverlap</b>
    <dd>Syntax: <tt>IfOverlap [Region</tt> <i>region_expr</i><tt>]</tt>
        <i>expression</i> [<i>string</i>]<br>

    <img src="ifoverlap.gif"><br>
    This test fails if any source figure is partially covered by the
    figures associated with the <i>expression</i>.  Unlike the
    <b>Overlap</b> keyword, this test does not fail if there is no
    intersection.  The <i>expression</i> must be either always true or
    always false at every point of a source figure, or for every
    object on the present layer if no <tt>Region</tt> is given.  The
    figure illustrates use of this keyword, for no <tt>Region</tt> and
    an expression consisting of a single layer.
    </dl>

    <a name="NoOverlap"></a>

    <dt><b>NoOverlap</b>

        <i>expression</i> [<i>string</i>]<br>

    <img src="nooverlap.gif"><br>
    This test fails if any source figure has non-zero intersection
    area with the figures associated with the <i>expression</i>.  The
    <i>expression</i> must evaluate false at every point of every
    source figure.  This is illustrated in the figure for no
    <tt>Region</tt> and an expression consisting of a single layer.

       <i>expression</i> [<i>string</i>]<br>

    <img src="anyoverlap.gif"><br>
    The <b>AnyOverlap</b> test signals a violation if any source figure
    has no intersection area with the figures associated with the
    <i>expression</i>.  This is illustrated in the figure for no
    <tt>Region</tt> and an expression consisting of a single layer.

       <i>expression</i> [<i>string</i>]<br>

    <img src="partoverlap.gif"><br>
    The <b>PartOverlap</b> test signals a violation if any source figure
    is either completely covered or completely uncovered by the
    figures associated with the <i>expression</i>.  This is
    illustrated in the figure for no <tt>Region</tt> and an expression
    consisting of a single layer.

    The <b>AnyNoOverlap</b> test signals a violation if any source figure

        <i>area</i> [<i>string</i>]<br>

    <p>
    For each object tested, the neighborhood of the object is searched
    for mutually touching, source compatible objects.  The area
    covered by the objects is computed, and this is compared with the
    given area (which is given in square microns).  If the computed
    area is less than the test value a DRC violation is indicated.

    <p>

    <p>
    The total area of the source figures is compared with the given
    area (which is given in square microns).  If the area of the
    figures is greater than the test value a DRC violation is
    indicated.  The area is measured on a per-object basis, and is the
    sum if there are multiple figures (due to a region expression). 
    This does not account for adjacent objects.

    <h2>Edge Rules</h2>

    In the discussion to follow, the "source" is the material of the
    object being checked, either a layer (on which the rule is
    defined) or a layer expression result if the <tt>Region</tt>
    specification is given.  The "target" is the set of figures
    associated with the <i>expression</i> supplied to the rule, for
    those rules that take an <i>expression</i>.

    <p>
    The rules described in this section are "edge tests" where the
    region of interest is generally a small constructed area along an
    edge.  The test is applied for each applicable edge portion of
    each source figure.  The constructed area is rectangular, parallel
    to the source figure edge, and may extend out of the source
    figure, or into the source figure.  These extend only along the
    parts of the source figure edge where certain conditions apply, as
    will be described.  The width of the test area (perpendicular to
    the figure edge) is the dimension associated with the rule.

    <p>
    We find the edge portions of a source figure as follows.  We
    iterate through the edges.  For each edge, we construct a
    unit-width test area that extends outside of the figure.  We throw
    out the parts of the edge where the test area intersects "source
    compatible figures", meaning the same layer or layer expresion as
    the source.  Thus we throw out the part of the edge which is not
    really an edge, but a boundary between dark areas of the same type
    and is therefor not a physical discontinuity.  The resulting edge
    portion is the starting point for further restrictions that are
    rule-specific.

    <p>
    Below is a table which identifies the edge portions identified for
    the built-in rules, and the test performed.

    <p>
    The first column specifies the built-in rule name of the "edge"
    rules.  These will be described in more detail below.  The
    <b>where</b> column indicates the direction of the constructed
    test area along a source figure edge, either projecting into the
    figure or outside of the figure.  The <b>test</b> indicates the
    type of test to perform in the constructed area.  These are

    <blockquote>
    <dl>
    <dt>len<dd>
    Measure the edge length and compare to given dimension.
    <dt>snf<dd>
    The test area is not fully covered by source-compatible material.
    <dt>sf<dd>
    The test area is fully covered by source-compatible material.
    <dt>se<dd>
    The test area contains no source-compatible material.
    <dt>tf<dd>
    The test area is fully covered by target-compatible material.
    <dt>te<dd>
    The test area contains no target-compatible material.
    </dl>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The three remaining columns indicate the part of the source figure
    edge that is used to construct the test area.  These indicate the
    required coverage of the source material just outside the edge,
    and target material just inside and just outside of the edge.  The
    possibilities are

    <blockquote>
    <dl>
    <dt>c<dd>
    Covered by the material.
    <dt>u<dd>
    Not covered by the material.
    <dt>x<dd>
    Doesn't matter.
    </dl>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    So, for example, for <tt>MinSpaceTo</tt>, we take the part of the
    edges that are not covered by source just outside of the edge,
    and not covered by target just inside of the edge.  The test will
    pass if the constructed area, which extends out of the figure,
    intersects no target material.

    <p>
    Each of the "edge" rules recognize two additional keywords:
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Outside</tt> <i>layer_expr</i><dd>
    This will apply when identifying the part of the edge of a source
    figure to use when constructing test areas.  The given layer expression
    must be dark along the edge just outside of the figure, in the parts of
    the edge to use for the test area.  This provides an additional
    rather arbitrary constraint on the test area construction which may
    be of use in some cases.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Inside</tt> <i>layer_expr</i><dd>
    This is very similar to the <tt>Outside</tt> constraint, but
    applies to the side of the edge just inside of the figure.  Only
    the parts of the edge where the given layer expression is dark
    just inside of the figure are considered for edges of the test
    area.
    </dl>

    For example:
    <blockquote>
    "The minimum distance to CO from a NP/PP butt edge over OD is 0.06
    microns."
    </blockquote>

    This can be implemented as
    <blockquote><tt>
    PhysLayer NP<br>
    MinSpaceTo Region OD Inside !PP Outside PP CO 0.06<br>
    PhysLayer PP<br>
    MinSpaceTo Region OD Inside !NP Outside NP CO 0.06
    </tt></blockquote>

    The built-in edge rules are described in more detail below.  In each,
    for simplicity we will use the following as an abbreviation for the
    syntax elements:
    <dl>
    <dt><i>EdgeArgs</i><dd>
    [<tt>Region</tt> <i>region_expr</i>]
    [<tt>Inside</tt> <i>inside_expr</i>]
    [<tt>Outside</tt> <i>outside_expr</i>]
    </dl>

    <a name="MinEdgeLength"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>MinEdgeLength</b>
    <dd>Syntax: <tt>MinEdgeLength</tt> [<i>EdgeArgs</i>]
        <i>expression length</i> [<i>string</i>]<br>

    <img src="minedgelength.gif"><br>
    This test checks the length of the edges where source and target
    figures intersect.  For each edge of the source figure, the parts
    of the edge where the <i>expression</i> is true on both sides of
    the edge are considered.  If the length of the part is less than
    the given <i>length</i>, a violation is flagged.

    <p>
    Example:
    <blockquote>
    Rule:  "M3 width must be 2u or greater when crossing over M2 edges."
    </blockquote>
 
    <p>
    This can be handled in two ways.  The first method is to put the
    rule in the M2 block:
 
    <p>
    <pre>
    Layer M2
    ...
    MinEdgeLength M3 2
    </pre>

    <p>
    The second approach is to put a slightly different implementation
    into the M3 block.  This has a problem in that if the M3 is
    composed of several objects which together provide the minimum
    edge length, this test will fail since it looks at the objects
    individually.

    <p>
    <pre>
    Layer M3
    ...
    MinEdgeLength Region M2 M3 2
    </pre>
    </dl>

    <a name="MaxWidth"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>MaxWidth</b>
    <dd>Syntax: <tt>MaxWidth</tt> [<i>EdgeArgs</i>]
        <i>width_in_microns</i> [<i>string</i>]<br>

    <p>
    For the parts of each edge of the source that are not coincident
    or overlapping with source-compatible figures, and the edge length
    is greater than the given dimension, a rectangle extending
    normally from the edge into the source figure by the given
    dimension plus a tiny extra is constructed.  The test fails if
    this constructed rectangle is completely covered by
    source-compatible figures.

    <p>
    The "tiny extra" is one internal unit for Manhattan edges.  An
    additional "fudge factor" is added for non-Manhattan edges to
    overcome roundoff error.

    <p>
    When importing Virtuoso technology data, the <tt>maxWidth</tt>
    constraint maps directly to this rule.
    </dl>

    <a name="MinWidth"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>MinWidth</b>
    <dd>Syntax: <tt>MinWidth</tt> [<i>EdgeArgs</i>]
        <i>width_in_microns</i> [<tt>Diagonal</tt> <i>alt_width</i>]
        [<i>string</i>]<br>

    <img src="minwidth.gif"><br>
    For the parts of each edge of the source that are not coincident
    or overlapping with source-compatible figures, a rectangle
    extending normally from the edge into the source figure by the
    given dimension is constructed.  The test fails if this
    constructed rectangle is not completely covered by
    source-compatible figures.  Note that the angle formed by two
    adjacent edges of a figure measured inside of the figure must be
    90 degrees or larger, i.e., this rule prevents acute angles in
    polygons.  The figure illustrates the test performed under this
    keyword, for no <tt>Region</tt>.

    <p>
    If the <tt>Diagonal</tt> clause is given and the <i>alt_width</i>
    is positive, the <i>alt_width</i> will be used when the edge being
    tested is nonorthogonal.

    <p>
    The <b>MinWidth</b> test also fails if the length of a line
    defined by the overlap points of two mutually overlapping corners
    of a source figure and another compatible figure is less than the
    given dimension, including the condition where corners of the two
    figures touch but the intersection area is zero.

    <p>
    When importing Virtuoso technology data, the <tt>minWidth</tt>
    constraint maps directly to this rule.

    <p>
    The <tt>Diagonal</tt> clause is set by <tt>minDiagonalWidth</tt>
    constraint when importing virtuoso technology data.  This may have
    its own reference string.  To keep this distinguishable, the
    <i>string</i> can actually be two double-quoted strings, e.g., the
    form is

    <blockquote><tt>
    "# rule description" "minDiagonalWidth string"
    </tt></blockquote>

    This guarantees that the original reference strings are
    regenerated when the <a href="!dumpcds"><b>!dumpcds</b></a>
    command is used to generate a Virtuoso technology file.  If a
    component string doesn't exist, one can use "" (two double-quote
    marks) as a placeholder.  Strings to the right that don't exist
    can be skipped entirely.

    For the parts of each edge of the source that are not coincident

    rectangle has nonzero intersection area with source-compatible

    performed under this keyword, for no <tt>Region</tt> and an
    <i>expression</i> consisting of a single layer.

    <p>
    If the <tt>Enclosed</tt> keyword is given, it requires that where
    the source and target intersect, the source is entirely covered by
    the target, with a spacing greater than or equal to the
    <i>enc_dimen</i> between outside edges.  This applies only if the
    source figure is rectangular.  If this clause is used, the
    <i>dimesnsion_in_microns</i> should be set to zero.

    <p>
    The <tt>Opposite</tt> clause also requires that if there is
    intersection, the source must be entirely covered by the target. 
    This test also applies only when the source shape is rectangular. 
    Two widths are given following the keyword.  The test passes if
    two opposite sides of the source rectangle have extension greater
    than or equal to the larger of the two numbers, and the other two
    edges have extensions greater than or equal to the smaller
    dimension.  If the two dimensions are equal, this is equivalent to
    the <tt>Enclosed</tt> clause.  When the two values are different,
    there is no corner test performed.  If this clause is given, the

    In either clause, a dimension value of 0.0 can be given, meaning
    that the source and target can share an edge.

    Without the clauses, this is in many cases redundant with the

Spacing Tables
!!HTML
    The design rule checking system supports one and two-dimensional
    spacing tables, for use in the <a
    href="MinSpace"><tt>MinSpace</tt></a> and <a
    href="MinSpaceTo"><tt>MinSpaceTo</tt></a> rules.  These provide a
    size-dependent spacing value.

    <p>
    Spacing tables may be <a href="ReadCdsTech">imported</a> from
    Cadence Virtuoso ASCII technology files, or may be created and
    used exclusively within <i>Xic</i>.  The format is the same as the
    <i>width</i> and <i>width-length</i> spacing tables found in
    Virtuoso constraint definitions.

    <p>
    In <i>Xic</i>, spacing tables are not independent objects, but are
    owned by a <tt>MinSpace</tt> or <tt>MinSpaceTo</tt> design rule. 
    Each rule of these types can have a spacing table.  The tables are
    printed when an <i>Xic</i> technology file is generated, as part
    of the rule specification string.  The rule text is printed using
    backslash line continuation characters for legibility, as the rule
    string will be rather long when the table is included.  The same
    format is used when listing rules in the <a
    href="xic:dredt"><b>Edit Rules</b></a> window, and in the text
    editor used to edit the spacing table text from the <a
    href="xic:ruleedit">rule editor</a> windows for these rules.

    <p>
    Below is the text for a spacing table, which will be explained
    as an example.

    <blockquote><tt>
    SpacingTable 0.0900 2 0x0 11\<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   0.0050 0.0050 0.0900\<br>

    </tt>
    </blockquote>

    The <tt>SpacingTable</tt> keyword begins the definition.  Note that
    each line ends with a backslash character.  This "hides" the return
    character, so that logically the text forms a single line.  One could
    certainly enter the text as a single line, the hidden line breaks are
    for readability only.  The kind and number of text tokens that form
    the definition are well defined, so there is no ambiguity in where
    the table definition ends, when it is included in a larger string.

    <p>
    Following the initial keyword are four numeric tokens.  The first
    is the default spacing in microns, as a floating-point number. 
    This will apply when the table does not resolve a value.  This
    should be the same number as the default spacing in the associated
    design rule, but will override that value if different.

    <p>
    The second number is the table dimensionality, which is either 1
    or 2.  The example is a two dimensional table, which is probably
    most common.  Each row of a two dimensional table contains three
    numbers, for <i>width</i>, <i>length</i>, and the spacing value. 
    In a one dimensional table, the <i>length</i> values are not
    present.

    <p>
    The third number is a hexadecimal value which is used as a flags
    byte.  The flags are saved in tables imported from Virtuoso, and
    represent unhandled features.  The only purpose of these flags is
    to regurgitate the needed keywords when a Cadence technology file
    is produced with the <a href="!dumpcds"><b>!dumpcds</b></a>
    command.  The flags are not documented, but the least significant
    bit is actually an "ignore" flag used only by <i>Xic</i>.  The
    main thing to be aware of is that the spacing table will only be
    active if the flags integer is 0.  If not zero, the table will be
    carried with the rule, but will not be used in analysis.  The
    default spacing, given in the first number, will apply in any
    case.

    <p>
    The fourth number is a positive integer giving the number of rows
    in the table.  Each "row" consists of two or three floating-point
    numbers, for one and two dimensional tables.  The row data
    follow.

    <p>
    The first number in each row is the <i>width</i> parameter.  In
    <i>Xic</i>, this parameter is obtained from the object whose edges
    are currently being evaluated for <tt>MinSpace</tt> or
    <tt>MinSpaceTo</tt> violations.  If the object is a rectangle, the
    <i>width</i> is the smaller of the rectangle width and height.  If
    the object is a wire, the <i>width</i> is the wire's width.  If
    the object is a non-rectangular polygon, the <i>width</i> is the
    smaller of the bounding box width and height.

    <p>
    In two-dimensional tables, the second parameter (<i>length</i>)
    is the parallel run length of the two edges normal to the spacing
    direction being tested.

    <p>
    The remaining parameter is a spacing value that applies for the
    given <i>width</i>, and <i>length</i> in two-dimensionsl tables.

    <h4>Spacing Table Evaluation</h4>

    Spacing tables are used only for Manhattan (horizontal or
    vertical) edges.  Non-Manhattan edges will use the
    <tt>Diagional</tt> spacing if given, or the default spacing. 
    There is presently no provision for size-dependent spacing of
    non-Manhattan edges.

    <p>
    The <i>minspace</i> dimension will be found in the row where the
    measured <i>width</i> and <i>length</i> are greater than or equal
    to the row <i>width</i> and <i>length</i>, with the largest
    spacing value.  The evaluation is actually iterative, and follows
    this logic:

    <blockquote>
    Compute the <i>width</i> parameter knowing the object being tested.<br>
    Loop over each object edge {<br>
    <blockquote>
      Take the initial <i>length</i> to be the total edge length.<br>
      Evaluate the spacing table, find the initial <i>minspace</i>.<br>
      Loop {<br>
      <blockquote>
        Construct a test region along and outside of the edge being tested,
        with width given by the <i>minspace</i>.<br>
        Test this region for the presence of target material.<br>
        if (none found)
        <blockquote>
            Break, edge test is clean.
        </blockquote>
        Measure the length of each intersection region and sum.  This
        provides a new <i>length</i>.<br>
        Evaluate the spacing table with the new <i>length</i>.<br>
        if (the new and old <i>minspace</i> are equal)
        <blockquote>
            Break, test indicates violation.
        </blockquote>
        The new <i>minspace</i> will be smaller, check again.
      </blockquote>
      }
    </blockquote>
    }
    </blockquote>

User-Defined Design Rules
!!HTML
    This section describes the facility for defining and referencing
    user-specified design rules.  These allow complex tests to be
    implemented.  User-defined rules are defined in separate blocks
    ahead of the physical layer specification blocks in the technology
    file.  The rules are referenced from the layer blocks.  A user
    defined rule definition has the following general form:

    <blockquote>
    <tt>DrcTest</tt> <i>testname arg1 arg2</i> ...<br>
    <tt>Edge Outside|Inside</tt> <i>expression</i><br>
    <tt>MinEdge</tt> <i>dimension</i><br>
    <tt>MaxEdge</tt> <i>dimension</i><br>
    <tt>Test Outside|Inside</tt> <i>dimension expression</i><br>
    <tt>TestCornerOverlap</tt> <i>dimension</i><br>
    <tt>Evaluate</tt> [<i>logical_expression</i>]<br>
    [ script lines ]<br>
    <tt>End</tt><br>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The first line of the block starts with the keyword
    <tt>DrcTest</tt>.  This is followed by a name for the test, which
    must be unique among the keywords recognized in the technology
    file.  This is the name by which the test will be referenced. 
    Following the name are zero or more argument tokens.  These can be
    any alphanumeric text strings, which represent parameter names. 
    These are the formal arguments to the rule, and appear in the
    lines that follow in the form "<tt>%</tt><i>token</i><tt>%</tt>",
    which will be replaced by the actual arguments given in the
    references to the rule.

    <p>
    The rule is evaluated at each edge of the source.  Each edge is
    divided into segments, depending on specifications.  For each
    segment, a rectangle is constructed, extending either into or out
    of the source figure.  Tests are applied to these regions,

    <p>
    The <tt>Edge</tt> keyword indicates an edge specification.  There
    can be zero or more edge specifications.  Following the
    <tt>Edge</tt> keyword is one of the keywords <tt>Outside</tt> or
    <tt>Inside</tt> followed by a <a href="layer_exp">layer
    expression</a>.  When the edge is evaluated the regions of the
    edge where the expression is true are found, either just inside or
    just outside of the figure.  The default edge is the set of
    regions where there is no source figure just outside the edge,
    which means that there is no source-compatible adjacent figure. 
    The results from each <tt>Edge</tt> specification are anded
    together with the default edge to determine the segments where
    tests are performed.  The expression part of the <tt>Edge</tt>
    specification can contain argument substitutions.

    <p>
    For example:
    <blockquote>
    <tt>Edge Inside M2</tt>
    </blockquote>
    This will include the parts of the figure boundary that 1) do not
    touch or overlap another figure of the same source (the default
    edge), and 2) have layer M2 present on the inside side of the
    boundary.  The default edge is always implicitly included in the
    conjunction.

    <p>
    The <tt>MinEdge</tt> and <tt>MaxEdge</tt> lines, which are
    optional, allow setting limits on the segments used for testing. 
    If given, an edge segment used for testing would have length
    greater or equal to the <tt>MinEdge</tt> dimension, and less than
    or equal to the <tt>MaxEdge</tt> dimension.  The dimensions
    appearing after the keywords can contain argument substitutions.

    <p>
    There must be one of more lines given which start with the keyword
    "<tt>Test</tt>".  These specify the tests which are applied to
    regions constructed from the edge segments.  Following
    <tt>Test</tt> is one of the keywords <tt>Outside</tt> or
    <tt>Inside</tt>, which determines whether the test area extends
    outside or inside the source figure.  The following token, which
    can contain an argument substitution, sets the length by which the
    test area extends out of or into the source figure.  The rest of
    the line contains a layer expression, which can contain argument
    substitutions, which is evaluated in the test area.

    <p>
    The expression will be evaluated within the test area by one of
    the evaluation functions described below.  If using the most
    common <tt>DRCuserTest</tt> evaluation function, the test is true
    if the expression is true somewhere in the test area, meaning that
    there is a non-zero area where the logical expression would be
    "dark".

    <p>
    For example:
    <blockquote>
    <tt>Test Outside 0.5 !M2</tt>
    </blockquote>
    This test will be "true" if within the rectangle extending out of
    the figure from the edge by 0.5 microns, there is some point where
    layer M2 is not present, if using <tt>DRCuserTest</tt>.

    <p>
    The optional <tt>TestCornerOverlap</tt> test is a special
    supplemental test when evaluating "<tt>MinWidth</tt>".  This
    measures the mutual edge or overlap of adjacent compatible
    figures.  The width of the mutual edge must be greater than the
    dimension (which can contain argument substitutions).

    <p>
    The final line, which begins with the keyword <tt>Evaluate</tt>,
    specifies a logical expression or script.  There are two forms for
    the <tt>Evaluate</tt> construct.  In the first form, the
    expression must be cast as an assignment to a variable named
    "<tt>fail</tt>", and if set true the entire rule fails.  Argument
    substitutions are allowed in the expression.  The assignment must
    appear on the same line following <tt>Evaluate</tt>.

    <p>
    In the second form, there can be no additional text on the line
    following <tt>Evaluate</tt>.  The following lines contain a
    script, in the format understood by the <a href="xicscript">script
    parser</a>.  This is terminated with the keyword
    <tt>EndScript</tt>.  Argument substitutions are allowed in these
    lines.  The script can contain any of the constructs described in
    the manual section on the script parser, with the exception of the
    "preprocessing" directives; any line with a leading '#' is
    ignored.  The script should set a variable named "<tt>fail</tt>"
    to signal a DRC violation.

    <p>
    There are several functions which can appear in the
    <tt>Evaluate</tt> lines.  Each of these functions takes a single
    integer argument.  This is a zero-based integer index
    corresponding to the <tt>Test</tt> lines, in order of their
    appearance.  Each function returns a value obtained from the
    corresponding test.

    <p>
    The functions currently available are the following:

    <dl>
    <dt>(int) <tt>DRCuserTest</tt>(<i>index</i>)
    <dd>The return value is 1 if the test region is not empty, 0
    otherwise.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt>(int) <tt>DRCuserEmpty</tt>(<i>index</i>)
    <dd>The return value is 1 if the test region is empty, 0
    otherwise.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt>(int) <tt>DRCuserFull</tt>(<i>index</i>)
    <dd>The return value is 1 if the test region is completely
    covered, 0 otherwise.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt>(zoidlist) <tt>DRCuserZlist</tt>(<i>index</i>)
    <dd>The return value is a list of trapezoids clipped from the
    test region.  The list can be used with script functions that
    operate with this data type.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt>(int) <tt>DRCuserEdgeLength</tt>(<i>index</i>)
    <dd>The return value is the length along the edge of the test
    region.  This is the value that is filtered by <tt>MinEdge</tt>
    and <tt>MaxEdge</tt>.  Filtered edges will not be seen by this
    function.
    </dl>

    <p>
    The functions specified are called for each test region for each
    edge and corner.  The return value can be used to set the
    <tt>fail</tt> variable.  Once the <tt>fail</tt> variable has been
    set nonzero, testing of the object terminates for the present
    rule.

    <p>
    For example:
    <blockquote>
    <tt>Test Outside 0.5 !M2</tt><br>
    <tt>Test Inside 0.5 !M2</tt><br>
    <tt>Evaluate fail = DRCuserTest(0) | DRCuserTest(1)</tt>
    </blockquote>
    Here, the test fails if M2 does not completely cover the area 0.5
    microns on either side of the edge.  The arguments to the
    DRCuserTest function refer to the <tt>Test</tt> lines:  0 is the
    first <tt>Test</tt> line in the rule, 1 the second, and so on.

    <p>
    The multi-line variation of the <tt>Evaluate</tt> clause has the
    form
    <blockquote>
    <tt>Evaluate</tt><br>
    <i>script line</i><br>
    ...<br>
    <tt>EndScript</tt>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Within the script, there are a number of predefined variables
    available.  With the exception of <tt>fail</tt>, these all start
    with an underscore.

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>_ObjType</tt>
    <dd>The type of object which is undergoing DRC.  Values are 'p',
    'w', or 'b', for polygons, wires, and boxes.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>_ObjNumEdges</tt>
    <dd>This is the number of vertices in the figure being tested. 
    Boxes and wires are converted to polygons for testing, so this
    makes sense for all objects.  The first and last vertices are the
    same, and all are counted, so that the number of vertices in a box
    is five.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>_CurEdge</tt>
    <dd>This is the zero-based index of the edge or vertex currently
    being tested.  If the original object is a box, the zeroth vertex
    is the lower-left corner, and the zeroth edge is the left edge. 
    For polygons, the zeroth vertex is the first vertex in the
    polygon's coordinate list, and the zeroth edge extends from this
    vertex to the next.  This index will cycle through the values from
    0 to <tt>_ObjNumEdges</tt>-1.  Values may be skipped of there is no
    testable area at the edge or corner.

    <p>
    If a test is identified as a "MinWidth" type, i.e., an inside test
    with the target the same as the source, at most two edges are
    tested if the figure is a box.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>_CurTest</tt>
    <dd>This gives the following values:  0 if the test is a standard
    edge test, 1 if the test if a corner test, and 2 if the test is
    the CornerOverlap test.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>_CurX1, _CurY1, _CurX2, _CurY2</tt>
    <dd>These four variables provide the starting and ending
    coordinates of the edge segment being tested, in microns
    </dl>

    <p>
    Variables defined within the script remain in scope forever, they
    do not change between calls.

    <p>
    When an object is DRC tested, the <b>Overlap</b> tests, if any,
    are first applied to the source region.  This is followed by the
    <b>Area</b> tests, then the edge tests, which include any
    user-defined tests.  During the edge tests, each edge is evaluated
    in sequence.  The test may be applied several times for different
    regions along the edge or not at all, depending on the geometry
    and the <tt>Edge</tt> specification.

    <p>
    Edge segments are evaluated in the order crossed by a point
    following the boundary starting at the first vertex (lower left
    corner for boxes).  Boxes and wires always have clockwise winding,
    though polygons can have either clockwise or counterclockwise
    winding.

    <p>
    Associated with the edge test are the corner tests.  For a box,
    the order of tests is given below.  The corner test is applied at
    each vertex (if indicated by the angle) after the previous
    adjacent side has been tested.  The test area is a polygonal shape
    designed to "fill in" gaps between the rectangular areas
    associated with the sides.

    <blockquote>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><td><tt>_CurEdge</tt></td> <td><tt>_CurTest</tt></td>
     <td>which</td></tr>
    <tr><td>0</td> <td>0</td> <td>left edge</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td> <td>1</td> <td>upper left corner</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td> <td>0</td> <td>top edge</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td> <td>1</td> <td>upper right corner</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td> <td>0</td> <td>right edge</td></tr>
    <tr><td>3</td> <td>1</td> <td>lower right corner</td></tr>
    <tr><td>3</td> <td>0</td> <td>bottom edge</td></tr>
    <tr><td>0</td> <td>1</td> <td>lower left corner</td></tr>
    </table>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    A rule is implemented by adding a reference to the rule in the
    layer block of a physical layer.  The format is

    <blockquote>
    <i>testname</i> <tt>[Region</tt> <i>region_expr</i><tt>] [</tt><i>arg1
        arg2</i></tt> ...] [<i>string</i>]
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The <i>testname</i> is the keyword defined in one of the rule
    definitions, as described above.  This is followed by an optional
    source specification, and the actual arguments, which must
    correspond in number to the rule arguments.  These are followed by
    an optional <i>string</i>, which is arbitrary explanatory text.

    <p>
    As initial examples, below are implementations of the built-in
    rules which involve edge evaluation.

    <p>
    These are the rule definitions, and by convention they would
    appear in the technology file after the electrical layer
    definitions and ahead of the physical layer definitions.

    <blockquote>
    <pre>
    # In the first two rules, lyr is the same as the source
    #
    DrcTest myMinWidth dim lyr
    Test Inside %dim% !%lyr%
    TestCornerOverlap %dim%
    Evaluate fail = DRCuserTest(0)
    End

    DrcTest myMinSpace dim lyr
    Test Outside %dim% %lyr%
    Evaluate fail = DRCuserTest(0)
    End

    # In the remaining rules, lyr is different from the source
    #
    DrcTest myMinSpaceTo dim lyr
    Edge Inside !%lyr%
    Test Outside %dim% %lyr%
    Evaluate fail = DRCuserTest(0)
    End

    DrcTest myMinSpaceFrom dim lyr
    Edge Inside %lyr%
    Test Outside %dim% !%lyr%
    Evaluate fail = DRCuserTest(0)
    End

    DrcTest myMinOverlap dim lyr
    Edge Inside %lyr%
    Test Inside %dim% !%lyr%
    Evaluate fail = DRCuserTest(0)
    End

    DrcTest myMinNoOverlap dim lyr
    Edge Inside !%lyr%
    Test Inside %dim% %lyr%
    Evaluate fail = DRCuserTest(0)
    End
    </pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    To implement the rules, references are added to the layer definitions:

    <blockquote>
    <pre>
    Layer M1
    ...
    myMinWidth  3.0 M1
    myMinSpace  2.0 M1 
    myMinSpaceTo 1.0 M2
    ...
    </pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Here are a few more complicated rules:

    <p>
    <b>Rule</b>:  Objects on M3 smaller that 10 microns must be
    separated by .5 microns or more, objects larger than 10 microns
    must be separated by .75 microns or more.

    <blockquote>
    <pre>
    DrcTest myMinSp1 lyr
    # Fail if spacing &#60 0.5
    Test Outside .5 %lyr%
    Evaluate fail = DRCuserTest(0)
    End

    DrcTest myMinSp2 lyr
    # Fail if spacing &#60 0.75 and width >= 10
    MinEdge 10
    Test Outside .75 %lyr%
    Test Inside 10 !%lyr%
    Evaluate fail = DRCuserTest(0) & !DRCuserTest(1)
    End

    Layer M3
    ...
    myMinSp1 M3
    myMinSp2 M3
    ...
    </pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Note that we did not need to use substitution here, as the rule
    only applies to M3.

    <p>
    <b>Rule</b>:  Objects on M3 must be larger than 1 micron, unless
    over I1 in which case the width must be 1.25 microns.

    <blockquote>
    <pre>
    DrcTest myMinW1 lyr
    # Fail if width &#60 1.0
    Test Inside 1 !%lyr%
    TestCornerOverlap 1
    Evaluate fail = DRCuserTest(0)
    End

    DrcTest myMinW2 lyr
    # Fail if width &#60 1.25 and I1 present
    Test Inside 1.25 !%lyr%
    Test Inside 1.25 I1
    TestCornerOverlap 1.25
    Evaluate fail = DRCuserTest(0) & DRCuserTest(1)
    End

    Layer M3
    ...
    myMinW1 M3
    myMinW2 M3
    ...
    </pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    <b>Rule</b>:  The overlap of M1 surrounding Via must be .5 microns
    or greater.  Only two sides maximum can have an overlap of less
    than 1 micron, the other sides must have 1 micron of overlap or
    more.

    <p>
    In the script below, two arrays are defined, to hold the test
    results.  We assume that only boxes are used for vias, and ignore
    the corner tests.  When the final edge (_CurEdge = 3) is reached,
    the results saved in the arrays are evaluated, and the fail flag
    is set if an error is indicated.

    <blockquote>
    <pre>
    DrcTest vtest
    Test Outside 1 !M1
    Test Outside .5 !M1
    Evaluate
    tl[4]
    ts[4]
    if (_ObjType == 'b' & _CurTest == 0)
    &#32   tl[_CurEdge] = DRCuserTest(0)
    &#32   ts[_CurEdge] = DRCuserTest(1)
    &#32   if (_CurEdge == 3)
    &#32       if (tl[0] + tl[1] + tl[2] + tl[3] > 2)
    &#32           fail = 1
    &#32       end
    &#32       if (ts[0] + ts[1] + ts[2] + ts[3] > 0)
    &#32           fail = 1
    &#32       end
    &#32   end
    end
    EndScript
    End
    </pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The test is implemented in the Via layer block.  Just the keyword
    is needed, since no arguments are passed.

    <blockquote>
    <pre>
    Layer Via
    ...
    vtest
    </pre>

Assigning Design Rules
!!HTML
    Design rules can be added to the technology file by hand with a
    text editor, or from within <i>Xic</i> using the <a
    href="xic:dredt"><b>Edit Rules</b></a> pop-up panel in the <b>DRC
    Menu</b>.  Note that if macros or the <tt>eval</tt> construct are
    to be used in design rules, the text must be inserted with a text
    editor, as these constructs are unknown to the <b>Edit Rules</b>
    pop-up.

    <p>
    <i>Xic</i> supports a set of design rule primitives which should
    cover the vast majority of cases encountered in process technology
    specifications.  In addition, more specialized tests can be
    developed through use of <a href="userrules">user-defined</a>
    design rules

    <p>
    Most simple specifications translate directly into a rule keyword,
    in particular, the setting of <tt>MinWidth</tt> and
    <tt>MinSpace</tt> are usually straightforward.  <tt>MinWidth</tt>
    is generally the smallest feature size allowable on the layer, and
    <tt>MinSpace</tt> is the smallest gap allowed between features on
    the layer.  Note that if one feature touches another on the same
    layer, the tests are applied such that the combined features are
    measured.  Thus it is legitimate to have subdimensional features,
    as long as they are directly adjacent to other features so that
    the combined dimensions satisfy the <tt>MinWidth</tt> test.

    <p>
    There are six rules which flag overlapping of layers
    <tt>Overlap</tt>, <tt>IfOverlap</tt>, <tt>NoOverlap</tt>,
    <tt>AnyOverlap</tt>, <tt>PartOverlap</tt>, and
    <tt>AnyNoOverlap</tt>.  Of these, the first three are by far the
    most commonly used.  If objects on layer A should always be
    over/under layer B, the <tt>Overlap</tt> rule should be added to
    layer A.  If objects on layer A should never intersect layer B,
    the <tt>NoOverlap</tt> rule should be applied to layer A.  The
    case of coincident layer A and B edges of adjacent objects will
    not produce an error, unless an additional <tt>MinSpaceTo</tt>
    test is applied.  If objects on layer A should either be entirely
    covered by layer B, or not intersect layer B at all, the
    <tt>IfOverlap</tt> rule should be added to layer A.  In this test,
    if an object on layer A partially intersects layer B, an error is
    generated.  This is useful for ensuring that a feature does not
    cross an underlying edge, for example.

    <p>
    In reciprocal rules, such as <tt>MinSpaceTo</tt>, which specifies
    the minimum distance between objects on two different layers, it
    is often questioned whether the rule should be specified in each
    layer.  The answer is no, although no real harm is done if it is
    specified in both layers, though both specifications had better
    provide the same dimension.  In testing of a newly created object
    (interactive DRC), first the object is tested with respect to
    rules defined on the object's layer.  If there are no errors, all
    nearby objects which have a rule target of the object's layer are
    tested, and any errors are flagged on the new object.  For example
    if a box on layer A is created too close to a box on layer B, and
    B contains a <tt>MinSpaceTo</tt> rule with respect to layer A,
    first the A box is tested (result:  ok) then the B box is tested,
    (result:  failure due to proximity to A).  The A box is marked and
    the error region is indicated.  In batch mode testing, only the
    rules for a given object are evaluated.  Typically, all objects in
    the region are tested, so the error will be caught.  If there were
    specifications on each layer, there would be two error messages
    produced, as two separate but redundant tests would be performed. 
    In the <tt>MinSpaceTo</tt> test, the condition where edges are
    coincident is flagged as an error, however if the two objects
    are actually intersecting with nonzero area, no error is generated
    from the <tt>MinSpaceTo</tt> test.

    <p>
    The word "overlap" is confusingly used in two contexts.  In
    process specifications, the "overlap" is often taken as the width
    of material surrounding a feature, such as a via.  In the
    <i>Xic</i> documentation, "overlap" often refers to an area of
    mutual intersection of two (or more) different layers.  As an
    important example, a process specification might read "overlap of
    M1 around VIA 1.0 micron".  This implies that layer M1 must extend
    1.0 microns or more outside of the VIA feature.  One way to test
    this condition is with the <tt>MinNoOverlap</tt> keyword as a rule
    on M1:  "<tt>MinNoOverlap VIA 1.0</tt>".  This specifies that a
    region along the outside edge of M1 1 micron in width toward the
    inside of the M1 feature will be checked for the presence of VIA,
    and an error will occur if any VIA material is found intersecting
    with this region.  The <tt>MinNoOverlap</tt> test will flag as an
    error the case where the edges of the two intersecting objects are
    coincident, however if the VIA area actually encloses M1, no error
    is generated.  The <tt>Overlap</tt> and <tt>IfOverlap</tt>
    keywords can be used to detect this circumstance.  Often, the
    process specification will list such a rule with the interior
    feature layer (VIA), in which case it makes more sense to use the
    <tt>MinSpaceFrom</tt> test as in "<tt>MinSpaceFrom M1 1.0</tt>"
    applied to the VIA layer.  This specifies that a region projecting
    outward from the VIA feature by 1 micron should be entirely
    covered by M1.  This is almost equivalent to the
    <tt>MinNoOverlap</tt> test, however the treatment of the corners
    is different.  This is illustrated in the figure.

    <p>
    <img src="viatest.gif">

    <p>
    In the case of coincident vias, where the order is not important
    but the concentric spacing must be greater than some value, mutual
    <tt>MinNoOverlap</tt> rules can exist in each layer.  In the case
    where one ordering is prohibited, the <tt>Overlap</tt> or
    <tt>IfOverlap</tt> keywords can be used in the inner layer.  For
    example, suppose VIA1 and VIA2 can be concentric, but VIA1 must be
    outside of (larger than) VIA2.  Layer VIA1 would contain a
    "<tt>MinNoOverlap VIA2</tt>" directive, layer VIA2 would contain
    an "<tt>IfOverlap VIA1</tt>" directive if VIA2 can exist
    independently of VIA1, or an "<tt>Overlap VIA1</tt>" directive
    otherwise.  Then, if VIA2 is larger than VIA1, the partial
    intersection will trigger an error.

    <p>
    The <tt>MinOverlap</tt> test is used to determine whether the
    intersection width of two layers is larger than some minimum.  It
    is usually used in conjunction with certain types of contacts or
    vias, to ensure that the contacting area is sufficiently large. 
    The <tt>MinArea</tt> and <tt>MaxArea</tt> tests are also useful is
    this regard.  In particular, to test that a via has an exact size
    (square), a <tt>MinWidth</tt> and a <tt>MaxArea</tt> test are both
    applied.  A <tt>MinEdgeLength</tt> test is used in the
    circumstance where the edge-crossing width of a layer is larger
    than the layer's minimum width.

    <b>Keyword</b>: <tt>limit</tt>

    <p>
    The <b>Setup</b> button in the <b>DRC Menu</b> brings up the
    <b>DRC Parameter Setup</b> panel, which allows the user to set
    limits and other parameters used in design rule checking.

    <p>
    The top third of the panel provides control of layer and rule
    filtering.  It is sometimes useful to perform design rule checking
    using only a subset of rules, on only a subset of layers.  It may
    also be useful at times to skip particular rules or layers.  The
    user has this flexibility through the entries in this panel.  One
    also has the ability to inhibit rules individually with the <a
    href="xic:dredt"><b>Design Rule Editor</b></a> panel from the
    <b>Edit Rules</b> button in the <b>DRC Menu</b>.

    <p>
    At the top of the panel are <b>Check listed layers only</b> and
    <b>Skip listed layers</b> check boxes.  If either is checked (it
    is not possible to select both) then the text entry area just
    below the check boxes becomes un-grayed, and the user is expected
    to enter a list of <a href="layername">layer names</a>, separated
    by space.  Rules on the listed layers will either be used
    exclusively or ignored during checking, depending on which of the
    boxes is checked.

    <p>
    The layer filtering entries control the status of two variables. 
    The filtering can also be set up by setting the values of the
    variables directly.

    <dl>
    <dt><a href="DrcLayerList"><b>DrcLayerList</b></a><dd>
    This variable is set to a space-separated list of layer names, as
    shown in the text entry area.  The variable exists only if there
    is text shown in the entry area.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><a href="DrcUseLayerList"><b>DrcUseLayerList</b></a><dd>
    If this variable is not set, then the <b>DrcLayerList</b> variable
    will be ignored if it exists, and DRC testing will use rules
    defined on all layers.  If the variable is set to a word that
    starts with '<tt>n</tt>' (case-insensitive) or just the letter
    itself, then the <b>DrcLayerList</b> will be used, if it exists,
    to provide a list of layers whose rules will be skipped during DRC
    testing.  If <b>DrcUseLayerList</b> is set to something else,
    including to nothing (set as a boolean), the <b>DrcLayerList</b>,
    if it exists, will supply a list of layers whose rules will be
    used during DRC testing.  Rules on unlisted layers will not be
    tested in this case.
    </dl>

    Below the layer list entry are <b>Check listed rules only</b> and
    <b>Skip listed rules</b> check boxes.  These, and the initially
    grayed text entry area just below, provide an analogous filtering
    capability based on rule names.  The rule names are the names
    (keywords) of the <a href="drcrules">built-in tests</a>, or the
    name assigned to a <a href="userrules">user-defined</a> rule.  If
    ether box is checked (it is possible to check at most one of the
    boxes), then the text entry area becomes un-grayed and the user
    should enter a space-separated list of rule names.  The name
    matching is case-insensitive.  The listed rules will either be
    checked exclusively (unlisted rules ignored) or skipped during DRC
    testing, depending on which box is checked.

    <p>
    The rule filtering entries control the status of two variables. 
    Rule filtering can also be set up by setting the values of the
    variables directly.

    <dl>
    <dt><a href="DrcRuleList"><b>DrcRuleList</b></a><dd>
    This variable is set to a space-separated list of rule names, as
    shown in the text entry area.  The variable exists only if there
    is text shown in the entry area.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><a href="DrcUseRuleList"><b>DrcUseRuleList</b></a><dd>
    If this variable is not set, then the <b>DrcRuleList</b> variable
    will be ignored if it exists, and DRC testing will use all rules
    that have been defined, and have not been inhibited.  If the
    variable is set to a word that starts with '<tt>n</tt>'
    (case-insensitive) or just the letter itself, then the
    <b>DrcRuleList</b> will be used, if it exists, to provide a list
    of rules that will be skipped during DRC testing.  If
    <b>DrcUseRuleList</b> is set to something else, including to
    nothing (set as a boolean), the <b>DrcRuleList</b>, if it exists,
    will supply a list of rules that will be used during DRC testing. 
    Unlisted rules will not be tested in this case.
    </dl>

    <p>
    Below the layer and rule filtering group is the limit values
    group.  These provide numeric limit values that are observed while
    testing.  Each of these controls has a corresponding <a
    href="!set:drc">tracking variable</a>.

    <p>
    The first limit is on the number of violations reported in batch
    mode checking.  These are runs initiated from the <a
    href="xic:check"><b>DRC Run Control</b></a> panel obtained from
    the <b>Batch Check</b> button in the <b>DRC Menu</b>.  If this
    limit is reached, the checking terminates.  Setting this limit (or
    any of the limits) to zero will inhibit the limiting.

    <p>
    The remaining limits pertain to interactive mode (the <a
    href="xic:intr"><b>Enable Interactive</b></a> button in the <b>DRC
    Menu</b> is active).  When enabled, these checks are performed
    after every operation which modifies the physical geometry in the
    database.  Often, the pause can be quite substantial, and it is
    preferable to minimize the delay, at the expense of thorough
    testing.  Testing can be performed at a later time using batch
    mode.  The interactive time can be limited in two ways:  by
    limiting the number of objects checked, and by actually setting a
    time limit.  The checking will also terminate when a maximum error
    count is reached.  Of course, interactive testing can be switched
    off entirely with the <b>Enable Interactive</b> button.

    <p>
    The object count limit specifies the maximum number of objects
    checked per test cycle.  The time limit, specified in
    milliseconds, will terminate testing when the time limit is
    reached.  The error count limit, if nonzero, will terminate
    testing when the count is reached.

    <p>
    The final choice is a yes/no as to whether to test subcells that
    are moved, copied, or placed.  This is often very time consuming,
    as all objects in the subcell and its descendents are checked.  If
    the subcell has been checked previously, most of the checking is
    redundant and can be skipped.

    <p>
    The remaining buttons allow selection of the violation recording
    level.  The default is to record only one violation per object.  With
    many violations, this can cut evaluation time, and may be useful for a
    first pass.  The second choice outputs a maximum of one violation of
    each type (i.e., corresponding to each rule name keyword) per
    object.  The third choice will output all violations found.  This can
    lead to redundancy, as certain violations may be reported for each
    <i>edge</i> of the offending object.

    The <b>Set Skip Flags</b> button in the <b>DRC Menu</b> enables
    the <b>skip DRC</b> flag to be set or cleared on objects in the
    current cell.  When the flag is set, the object is ignored by the
    DRC tests.  Note that this can cause other tests to fail, for
    example if a subdimensional object is adjacent to another object
    on the same layer with its skip flag set, the error will be
    reported.  Objects with the skip flag set are shown as selected. 
    The selected objects can be deselected, or other objects selected,
    in the usual way.  In any case, the selected status when the
    command exits will be represented in the objects' skip flags.

    <p>
    If the layer has the <a

    <p>
    Objects which intersect a layer named "NDRC" are also skipped
    during DRC testing.  Defining an NDRC layer is an easy way to
    avoid testing logos, process test features, and other objects
    which would ordinarily produce many errors.

    <p>
    The <b>Batch Check</b> button in the <b>DRC Menu</b> provides the
    <b>DRC Run Control</b> panel.  This panel allows initiation of a
    batch DRC job, running either in the foreground or background.  By
    "batch", it is meant that the job is not intended to be
    interactive.  Such jobs may take a long time to run.

    <p>
    The panel has two pages, tabbed <b>Run</b> and <b>Jobs</b>.  The
    <b>Run</b> page is generally of most interest and is the default
    page.

    <p>
    The top two entries in the <b>Run</b> page allow a <a
    href="xic:hier"> Cell Hierarchy Digest</a> (CHD) to specify the
    source cells for the DRC run.  A CHD is a small database of cell
    offsets into a large layout file, which allows access to the
    content of the file without reading it into <i>Xic</i>.  With
    limited memory, this allows huge files to be accessed, that would
    otherwise fail to load due to memory limitation.  The first line
    contains a text entry area into which the user enters the CHD
    name.  This will be ignored unless the <b>Use</b> button, to the
    left of the text entry, is pressed.  The second line is optional,
    and may contain the name of a cell referenced by the CHD.  This
    will be taken as the top-level cell in design rule checking.  If
    no entry is given, the default top-level cell of the CHD is used.

    <p>
    These entry areas mirror the values of the <a
    href="DrcChdName"><b>DrcChdName</b></a> and <a
    href="DrcChdCell"><b>DrcChdCell</b></a> variables.  The variables
    are set when the corresponding entry area contains text, unset
    otherwise.  The variables can be set directly, however in any case
    the <b>Use</b> button must be pressed for the values to have any
    effect during the DRC run.

    <p>
    In order to gain any memory-saving benefit from using a CHD, a
    partition grid should generally be used.  This is set in the third
    row of the <b>Run</b> page.  When the partition grid is enabled,
    the area to test is divided into a grid of the specified size. 
    The DRC testing is performed sequentially for each grid area.  In
    the case of CHD input, only the geometry needed to represent the
    current grid area is in memory, which should be a small fraction
    of the geometry of the total test area (if the test area is very
    small, partitioning is not needed).

    <p>
    To set up a partition grid, un-press the button with the
    <b>None</b> label.  This will un-gray the text entry area to the
    right.  This area should be set to the side length in microns of
    the square grid cell.  The size should be small enough so that the
    geometry needed to represent the area will easily fit in memory,
    but not so small that the overhead inherent in the gridding
    increases run time appreciably.  The best value is very dependent
    on the technology, and the user should experiment.

    <p>
    The partition setting entry and button control, and are controlled
    by, the <a href="DrcPartitionSize"><b>DrcPartitionSize</b></a>
    variable.  When this variable is set to a number, that number is
    taken as the partition grid spacing.  The partition size can be
    set and the use of partitioning enabled by setting this variable
    directly.

    <p>
    The partition grid also applies when the current cell is the
    target of the design rule checking.  It is not clear at present
    that the partition grid provides any advantage in this case.  Some
    operations may be performed faster when gridded as opposed to
    processing the entire layout, due to scaling properties.  The use
    of the partition grid provides something for the user to
    experiment with.

    <p>
    By default, a DRC test run will test the entire area of the target
    cell (either the current cell, or the cell implied from the CHD).
    The group of controls below the <b>Partition grid size</b> entries
    allows the testing area to be set to an arbitrary rectangular window.
    Of course, the window coordinates should overlap the cell coordinates,
    or no testing will be done.

    <a name="set"></a>
    <p>
    When the <b>Set</b> button is pressed, a command is active where
    if the user drags, or clicks twice to define the corners of a rectangle,
    those values will set the numerical entries on the panel.  This can be
    used to visually set the test area to an area of interest in the displayed
    layout.  This works whether or not the window is actually used, i.e.,
    whether or not the numeric coordinate entry areas are grayed.

    <p>
    The window will be ignored unless the <b>Use Window</b> check box
    is checked.  When checked, the numerical coordinate entry areas
    become un-grayed, and the user can manually enter the window
    coordinates.

    <p>
    The <b>Flatten</b> check box is un-grayed only when the <b>Use</b>
    (use CHD) button is pressed.  When checked, as geometry is being
    read into memory with the CHD, it will be flattened into a single
    cell.  Thus, DRC tests will be applied to a flat cell, which can be
    more efficient than processing a hierarchy.  However, there is
    overhead in flattening, and the flat representation can take much
    more memory than a hierarchical representation.  This should
    generally be employed only when using a partition grid or small
    window.  The feature is rather experimental and obscure.

    <p>
    Near the bottom of the <b>Run</b> page are large <b>Check</b> and
    <b>Check in Background</b> buttons.  These will launch a DRC run
    in the foreground or background.  The run will observe the other
    settings in the panel (and in the <a href="xic:limit"><b>DRC
    Parameter Setup</b></a> panel).

    <p>
    When a job is started in the foreground with the <b>Check</b>
    button, the button remains pressed until the job completes.  If
    the user un-presses the button, the job will be paused, and can be
    terminated by the user.  The job can also be paused by pressing
    <b>Ctrl-c</b> when <i>Xic</i> has keyboard focus.  Other
    operations are locked out while DRC is running.  Violations are
    recorded in a file named <tt>drcerror.log.</tt><i>cellname</i>
    which is written in the current directory.  Additionally, if not
    using a CHD, violating objects are marked, and the error region
    highlighted.

    <p>
    <img src="screenshots/drcrun2.png" align=right>
    <p>
    When a foreground job is running, <i>Xic</i> is busy and unusable. 
    When a job is started in the background, however, <i>Xic</i> is
    available for other tasks.  There can be multiple spawned
    processes executing concurrently.  A pop-up window will appear
    alerting the user that a job has completed.

    <p>
    Unlike the foreground run, violations are not marked on-screen. 
    The <a href="xic:erupd"><b>Update Highlighting</b></a> button can
    be used to generate the highlighting after a background run
    completes.  If the <a href="xic:next"><b>Show Errors</b></a> mode
    is active, and the current cell is the same as that being checked,
    when a background job terminates, the error display window is
    popped down and the mode terminates.

    <p>
    The spawned process is set to ignore the <tt>SIGHUP</tt> signal,
    so that the process will continue to run if the user's shell is
    destroyed and/or the user logs out.  This is the preferred method
    by which large, batch DRC jobs can be performed.

    <p>
    This process will create an errors file in the current directory
    named <tt>drcerror.log.</tt><i>cellname</i><tt>.</tt><i>PID</i>
    where <i>PID</i> is the process id of the spawned process.

    <p>
    Under Windows, this works by executing a <a
    href="xic:batch">batch-mode</a> <i>Xic</i> process in the
    background.  Presently, this doesn't allow background jobs to use
    a CHD or partitioning.

    <p>
    The <b>Jobs</b> page provides a list of background jobs currently
    running.  Jobs can be selected by clicking on the text.  When a
    job is selected, the <b>Abort job</b> button becomes un-grayed. 
    Pressing this button will halt the selected job.  Be aware that
    there is no confirmation, and it is not possible to restart a job
    that is halted in this manner.  The spawned process can also be
    stopped or killed using the job control functionality of the
    user's shell.

    The <b>Dump Error File</b> button in the <b>DRC Menu</b> allows
    the user to dump a file containing the error records for the
    currently visible (as highlighting) errors.

    <p>
    The user is first given the chance to provide the file name, which
    should begin with "<tt>drcerror.log</tt>" to be recognized as a
    DRC errors file for subsequent reading into <i>Xic</i>.  After the
    file is created, the user is given the option to view the file in
    a <b>File Browser</b> window.  If no file name is given, the file
    will be written to a temporary file which is erased on program
    exit.  This may be convenient if the user only wants a quick view
    of the text.

    <p>
    Tha <a href="xic:erupd"><b>Update Highlighting</b></a> command
    button provides the reverse operation, recreating the highlighting
    from an existing error log file.

    <p>
    The <b>Update Highlighting</b> button in the <b>DRC Menu</b> will
    delete the internal list of DRC error highlighting indicators, and
    rebuild the list from a DRC error log file.  The error log file
    must exist in the current directory, have a file name beginning
    with "<tt>drcerror.log</tt>", and apply to the current cell.  If
    there are multiple files found, a listing will appear, allowing
    the user to make a choice.  After selecting an entry, pressing the
    <b>Apply</b> button on the list pop-up will continue the
    operation.

    <p>
    DRC error files are produced by the batch mode checking operations
    initiated from the <a href="xic:check"><b>DRC Run Control</b></a>
    panel.  In the foreground check, the highlighting list is
    generated along with the file, however no highlighting is produced
    in background checking, so this command can be used to visualize
    the errors in that case.  It can also be used to bring back the
    highlighting that was cleared with the <a
    href="xic:clear"><b>Clear Errors</b></a> command, if there is a
    corresponding error log file.

    <p>
    The <a href="xic:erdmp"><b>Dump Error File</b></a> command
    performs the reverse operation, creating an error log file from
    the internal highlighting list.

    <p>
    The <a href="!errs"><b>!errs</b></a> prompt line command performs
    the same operations as this button.

    After batch rule checking (using the operations initiated from the
    <a href="xic:check"><b>DRC Run Control</b></a> panel) is
    performed, or in any case when a compatible DRC error log file is
    present in the current directory, errors from the file may be
    graphically viewed sequentially with the <b>Show Errors</b> button
    in the <b>DRC Menu</b>.

    <p>
    When the <b>Show Errors</b> button is pressed, if there is only
    one error log file for the current cell, it is loaded, otherwise a
    list of files is presented and the user must make a selection,
    then press the <b>Apply</b> button.  If a file is successfully
    loaded, the <b>Show Errors</b> button in the menu will be shown
    active, and a message will appear in the prompt area.  The search
    for error files extends only to the current directory, and only to
    files with a name beginning with "<tt>drcerror.log</tt>".  The
    file must have been generated from a cell with the same name as
    the current cell.

    <p>
    This sets a mode where pressing the <b>PageDown</b> key will
    display the first and subsequent errors in a sub-window.  The
    <b>PageUp</b> key can be used to view previously displayed errors. 
    The <b>Ctrl-f</b> key performs the same operation as
    <b>PageDown</b>, and the <b>Ctrl-b</b> and <b>Ctrl-p</b> keys are
    equivalent to <b>PageUp</b>.

    <p>
    The <b>PageDown</b> or <b>Ctrl-f</b> keys can be used to access
    the errors randomly, by number.  Entering a number followed by
    <b>PageDown</b> or <b>Ctrl-f</b> will display the corresponding
    error.  One can also enter <b>+</b> or <b>-</b> ahead of the
    number, in which case <b>PageDown</b> and <b>Ctrl-f</b> will move
    backward or forward in the list by the number.

    <p>
    The functionality is maintained until the <b>Show Errors</b>
    button is selected a second time, making it inactive, or the
    sub-window is dismissed.  The mode <i>cannot</i> be exited with
    the <b>Esc</b> key.  Any command can be executed when the <b>Show
    Errors</b> button is active, making it possible to interactively
    fix the errors without leaving <b>Show Errors</b> mode.

    <p>
    If a DRC background run terminates when the <b>Show Errors</b>
    mode is active, and the checked cell is the same as the current
    cell, the error display window will be popped down, and the mode
    exited.  The mode can be restarted to view the errors from the new
    file.

    <p>
    Note that in the sub-window, only the current error is
    highlighted, whereas in other windows, all errors may be
    highlighted, if a highlighting list exists.  The highlighting list
    can be created or rebuilt from the file with the <a
    href="xic:erupd"><b>Update Highlighting</b></a> button.

    <p>
    <b>Show Errors</b> mode is terminated if a new cell is opened for
    editing, including <a href="xic:push"><b>Push</b></a> and <a
    href="xic:pop"><b>Pop</b></a>, and upon switching to electrical

    The <b>Create Layer</b> button in the <b>DRC Menu</b> will create
    objects on a given layer corresponding to the error regions in the
    current highlighting list.  These are the actual error regions
    with solid outline highlighting, and not the "bad" objects which
    are also marked but with a dashed outline.  This operation can be
    useful for adding the errors to a design file for subsequent
    processing, and for other purposes.

    <p>
    The <a href="xic:erupd"><b>Update Highlighting</b></a> command
    button can be used to generate a highlighting list from an
    existing DRC error log file.

    <p>
    The user is first prompted for a layer name.  Any suitable layer
    name can be given.  A new layer will be created if the name does
    not match an existing name.

    <p>
    The layer will be cleared before the operation starts.  Objects
    (database polygons and boxes) will be created only in the current
    cell.

    <p>
    A second prompt allows the user to provide an integer property
    value.  If the user supplies a value larger than 0, a property
    will be applied to each object with the given number, containing a
    string with the text of the corresponding error message.  The <a
    href="xic:props"><b>Show Phys Properties</b></a> mode, available
    from the <b>Main Window</b> sub-menu of the <b>Attributes Menu</b>
    and the <b>Attributes</b> menu of sub-windows, can be used to

    <p>
    The <b>Edit Rules</b> button in the <b>DRC Menu</b> brings up the
    <b>Design Rule Editor</b> panel.  The editor contains a listing of
    design rules for the current layer.  The rules for any layer can
    be displayed by clicking in the <a href="layertab">layer menu</a>
    and selecting a new layer.  Design rules for the current layer can
    be added, deleted, modified, or disabled.  The <a
    href="xic:updat"><b>Save Tech</b></a> command in the <a
    href="xic:attrmenu"><b>Attributes Menu</b></a> can be used to
    write a new technology file in the current directory that reflects
    the changes made.

    <p>
    The <a href="drcrules">rules</a> are listed one per line, using
    the same syntax as in the specification in the <a
    href="techfile">technology file</a>.  Rules are shown after any
    technology file macros have been expanded, and macros can not be
    used in new rules entered from the <b>Design Rule Editor</b>
    panel.  Clicking with button 1 on a rule will cause it to become
    selected (or deselected if it was already selected).  Selected
    rules are acted on by the <b>Edit</b>, <b>Delete</b>, and
    <b>Inhibit</b> commands in the <b>Edit</b> menu of the <b>Design
    Rule Editor</b> panel.  The selected rule is shown highlighted.

    <p>
    The <b>Quit</b> button in the <b>Design Rule Editor</b> panel
    <b>Edit</b> menu retires the rules panel.  This can also be
    accomplished by pressing the <b>Edit Rules</b> button in the
    <b>DRC Menu</b> a second time.

    <p>
    If a rule is selected, pressing the <b>Edit</b> button in the
    <b>Edit</b> menu will cause the <a href="xic:ruleedit"><b>Design
    Rule Parameters</b><a> entry panel to appear if not already
    visible, from which the rule parameters can be modified.  Once
    parameters are modified, the <b>Apply</b> button will make the
    changes and update the listing, and dismiss the panel.  The rule
    most recently edited can be reverted to the previous parameters
    with the <b>Undo</b> button in the <b>Edit</b> menu of the
    <b>Design Rule Editor</b> panel.

    <p>
    If a rule is selected, pressing the <b>Delete</b> button deletes
    the rule from the current layer.  The most recently deleted rule
    can be restored with the <b>Undo</b> button.  Deleted rules are
    really gone, and will not be written to the technology file during
    update.

    <p>
    The <b>Inhibit</b> button toggles the inhibited status of the
    rules.  An inhibited rule is listed with an 'I' in the first
    column, and is not applied when checking is performed.  It is
    useful on occasion to temporarily disable a rule.  The <a
    href="xic:updat"><b>Save Tech</b></a> command will write all rules
    present to the technology file, inhibited or not.  The inhibited
    status is active only for the current <i>Xic</i> session.

    <p>
    If a rule is selected, pressing the <b>Inhibit</b> button will
    change the inhibited state of the selected rule, and deselect the
    rule.

    <p>
    The <b>Undo</b> button undoes the last edit, addition or delete
    operation.  A second press will redo the undo.

    <p>
    The <b>Rules</b> menu bar item produces a drop-down menu
    containing the names of the built-in <a href="drcrules">design
    rules</a>.  Selecting a button will cause the <a
    href="xic:ruleedit"><b>Design Rule Parameters</b><a> entry panel
    to appear if not already visible, from which the rule parameters
    can be entered.  Once parameters are entered, the <b>Apply</b>
    button will add the rule and update the listing, and dismiss the
    panel.  A new rule will replace an existing rule of the same type
    and target layer.  There is also an entry which allows references
    to user-defined rules to be created.  If user-defined rules have
    been defined, the entry produces a sub-menu of the defined rules. 
    Selecting one allows instantiation on the current layer.

    <p>
    The <b>Rule Block</b> button produces a drop-down menu containing
    the names of existing user-defined rules, plus entries <b>New</b>,
    <b>Delete</b>, and <b>Undelete</b>.  Selecting one of the rule
    entries brings up a <a href="texteditor">text editor</a> window
    loaded with the rule block text.  The text can be modified, and
    when saved the internal rule will be updated.  This will be
    reflected in the technology file created with the <a
    href="xic:updat"><b>Save Tech</b></a> button in the <a
    href="xic:attrmenu"><b>Attributes Menu</b></a>.  Selecting the
    <b>New</b> entry will open an empty editing window, into which the
    text of a new rule can be inserted.  Saving the text adds the new
    rule to the internal list.

    <p>
    To delete a user-defined rule, press the <b>Delete</b> button in
    the <b>Rule Block</b> menu, then select a rule from the same menu. 
    That rule will be removed from the menu.  The rule can be restored
    with the <b>Undelete</b> menu entry, but only one deletion is
    remembered.  When a rule block is deleted, all instances of the
    rule (in the layers) are inhibited, but not deleted.  They are
    cleared when the internal backup copy of the deleted rule is
    deleted, which happens on the next rule deletion or when the
    pop-up is dismissed.  If a rule is undeleted, its instances are
    uninhibited.

    <p>
    When a user-defined rule is edited and saved, the instances of the
    old rule (of the same name) are inhibited, but are not cleared. 
    The old rule instances are left as an indication of where the
    previous rule was applied and what arguments it takes.  To apply
    the new rule, the old instances should be deleted by hand, and a
    new instance created.  If the inhibited rules are uninhibited from
    the menu, the old rule will be used, not the new one.  If a
    technology file is created with the <b>Save Tech</b> command, the
    inhibited rules will be included, so that it is important to
    delete these if the call to the new rule is different from the
    call to the old.

    <p>
    There are entries that are common to multiple rules.  All rules
    have an entry labeled "<b>Decsription string</b>", which contains
    optional arbitrary text which explains the rule or provides a
    reference.  This text will appear in violation messages.
    All rules but <tt>Exist</tt> contain an entry labeled "<b>Layer
    expression to AND with source figures on current layer
    (optional)</b>".  This is the optional <tt>Region</tt>
    specification.  In addition, the "edge" rules contain two entries: 
    "<b>Layer expression to AND at inside edges when forming test
    areas (optional)</b>" and similar for outside edges.  These can
    provide values for the optional <tt>Inside</tt> and
