Technology File
!!HTML
    The technology file tells <i>Xic</i> all it knows about the layers
    and display attributes, as well as being a general source of
    initialization information.  The name of the file is
    <tt>xic_tech</tt>, and an extension .<i>xxx</i> can be added to
    the name, so that if <i>Xic</i> is started with the
    <tt>-T</tt><i>xxx</i> option, the technology file with the
    extension will be used.  For example, <tt>-Ttrw</tt> would try to
    read <tt>xic_tech.trw</tt>.

    <p>
    It is legitimate to start <i>Xic</i> without reading a technology
    file, by using "<tt>xic -T</tt>".  In this case, new layers will
    be assigned as needed as cells are read in.  This can be useful
    for examining an undocumented GDSII file, for example.  Once the
    layout has been read in, new colors and fill styles can be
    assigned, and the <a href="xic:updat"><b>Save Tech</b></a> command
    used to dump an appropriate technology file for the next time.

    <p>
    The technology file is sought first in the current directory
    (where <i>Xic</i> was started).  If the environment variable <a
    href="XIC_TECH_DIR"><b>XIC_TECH_DIR</b></a> is set to a directory
    path, that directory is searched.  If a subdirectory of the
    current directory named "<tt>techfiles</tt>" exists, it is
    searched next.  Finally, the technology file is searched for along
    the library <a href="xicpaths">search path</a>.  The library path
    can be set with the <a href="xic:env">environment</a> variable
    <b>XIC_LIB_PATH</b>.  The default path is
    <blockquote>
    <tt>( .  /usr/local/xictools/xic/startup)</tt>.
    </blockquote>
    The first matching terchnology file found in the search will be
    used.  The default technology file has been provided by your
    system administrator.  A personalized version can be generated
    with the <b>Save Tech</b> command.

    <p>
    The technology file generally begins with <a
    href="techfile:comments">comment lines</a> explaining the process
    that the file supports.  The order of the sections that follow is
    rather flexible, though the printer driver blocks should appear
    last.  It is recommended that one follow the ordering described
    here, which is the order used by <i>Xic</i> when generating a
    technology file, to be on the safe side.  None of the sections is
    required to exist.  Technology files for <a
    href="xicii"><i>XicII</i></a> and <a href="xiv"><i>Xiv</i></a>
    feature sets are simplified, omitting the sections that apply to
    unavailable features.

    <p>
    At the top of the file are <a href="techfile:macros">macro
    definitions</a> using the <tt>Set</tt> or <tt>Define</tt>
    keywords, and <a href="techfile:set"><b>!set</b> lines</a> for
    setting global variables.  The introductory part of the file
    further consists of optional <a href="techfile:paths">path
    specifications</a>.  The <a href="techfile:layers">layer
    blocks</a> follow, which is where the core information about the
    particular technology resides.  The electrical layers are defined
    first, followed by <a href="userrules">user-defined design
    rules</a>, followed by the physical layer definitions.

    <p>
    The physical layers are followed by the <a
    href="techfile:stdvia">standard via</a> definitions, then the <a
    href="ext:deviceblock">device blocks</a>, where physical
    characteristics for device extraction are given.  These are
    followed by <a href="techfile:scripts">script function
    definitions</a>.  Finally, there is a section containing <a
    href="techfile:attr">display attribute specifiers</a> and other
    parameters, and the <a href="hcopytech">hard-copy driver</a>
    parameter blocks.

    <p>
    Long lines can be continued in the technology file by using backslash
    continuation.  For example, the following would be read as one line:
    <blockquote>
      <tt>This is a line to be continued, the backslash \<br>
      must be the last character in the line.</tt>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The technology file has a <a href="techfile:macros">macro
    facility</a> which can be used to simplify the constructs and to
    customize the file to a particular variation of the technology.

    <p>
    <a name="techname"></a>
    The technology file may contain the following keyword/value pair
    near the top of the file:

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Technology</tt> <i>name</i>
    <dd>The <i>name</i> can be any character token (no white space
    allowed) and gives a name to the technology.  This is not directly
    used by <i>Xic</i>, but the <i>name</i> is placed in the macro
    name space of the <a href="macro">macro preprocessor</a> used when
    reading various types of input files, including the device
    library.  The name is displayed in the <a href="statusline">status
    line</a>, of the main window, and is part of the information
    available for output in scripts and elsewhere.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>DeviceLibrary</tt> <i>libname</i>
    <dd>The <i>libname</i> is the name of a <a href="devlib">device
    library</a> file which provides device outlines for use in
    schematics.  If not given, the name defaults to
    "<tt>device.lib</tt>".  The <i>libname</i> should be a file name,
    without any directory path.  A file by that name should be found
    in the library <a href="xicpaths">search path</a> on program
    startup.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>ModelLibrary</tt> <i>libname</i>
    <dd>The <i>libname</i> is the name of a <a href="modlib">model
    library</a> file which provides SPICE models for use in SPICE
    output.  If not given, the name defaults to "<tt>model.lib</tt>". 
    A file by that name should be found in the library search path on
    program startup.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>ModelSubdir</tt> <i>dirname</i>
    <dd>The <i>dirname</i> is the name of a subdirectory of the
    directories of the library search path, in which are found SPICE
    model files.  All directories of this name found in the library
    path will be searched for SPICE models.  If not given, the name
    defaults to "<tt>models</tt>".
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><a href="ReadDRF"><tt>ReadDRF</tt></a> <i>filename</i><dd>
    This is part of the <a href="cdscompat">Cadence&#174;
    compatibility package</a>.  The <i>filename</i> is the name of or
    path to a file in the format of a Virtuoso display resource file
    (including those from the Ciranova <a href="pycell">PyCell
    Studio</a>).  The full path should be given unless the file is in
    the library <a href="xicpaths">search path</a>.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><a href="ReadCdsTech"><tt>ReadCdsTech</tt></a> <i>filename</i><dd>
    This is part of the <a href="cdscompat">Cadence&#174;
    compatibility package</a>.  The <i>filename</i> is the name of or
    path to a file in the format of a Virtuoso ASCII technology file. 
    The full path should be given unless the file is in the library <a
    href="xicpaths">search path</a>.  This provides layer and purpose
    definitions, rules, constraints, and other technology data.
    Layers defined in this file will appear in addition to those
    defined elsewhere.
    </dl>

!!IFDEF OpenAccess
    <dl>
    <dt><a href="ReadOaTech"><tt>ReadOaTech</tt></a> <i>library</i><dd>
    This will obtain Virtuoso technology information directly from
    OpenAccess.  The <i>library</i> is an OpenAccess library, listed
    in the <tt>lib.defs</tt> or <tt>cds.lib</tt> file.  This obtains
    technology information by use of the OpenAccess <a
    href="oaplugin">plug-in</a>.  There should be no reason to use
    both this and <tt>ReadCdsTech</tt>, as they should retrieve the
    same information.
    </dl>
!!ENDIF

    <dl>
    <dt><a href="ReadCdsLmap"><tt>ReadCdsLmap</tt></a> <i>filename</i>
    <dd>This is part of the <a href="cdscompat">Cadence&#174;
    compatibility package</a>.  The <i>filename</i> is a path to a
    Virtuoso layer-mapping file, which provides GDSII layer/datatype
    numbers for the layers.  This can be used in addition to, and must
    be called after, <tt>ReadCdsTech</tt>.  It is used to import the
    Stream mapping for the layers.
    </dl>

    <a name="ReadCniTech"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><a href="ReadCniTech"><tt>ReadCniTech</tt></a> <i>filename</i><dd>
    The <i>filename</i> is the name of or path to a file in the format
    of a Ciranova (now Synopsys) ASCII technology file.  The full path
    should be given unless the file is in the library <a
    href="xicpaths">search path</a>.  This file format is
    superficially similar to a Virtuoso ASCII technology file, yet
    sufficiently different that a separate reader is required.
!!IFDEF OpenAccess
    The format is documented in the <a href="pycell">PyCell Studio</a>
    distribution from Synopsys, and example files are provided.
!!ELSE
    The format is documented in the PyCell Studio distribution from
    Synopsys.
!!ENDIF

    <p>
    When setting up a technology file for the PyCell Studio or
    something similar using Ciranova technology,
    it may be necessary to use this keyword more than once, if the
    technology is described in more than one file.  It is also necessary
    to use the <tt>ReadDRF</tt> keyword to read display resource files.

    <p>
    For example, here is a skeletal technology file for the Ciranova
    130nm model process in the PyCell Studio, which is installed under
    <tt>/usr/local/ciranova</tt>.
    <blockquote>
    <tt>Set cni130 = /usr/local/ciranova/tech/cni130</tt><br>
    <tt>ReadDRF $(cni130)/santanaDisplay/SantanaDisplay.drf</tt><br>
    <tt>ReadCniTech $(cni130)/santanaTech/Santana.tech</tt><br>
    <tt>ReadCniTech $(cni130)/santanaDisplay/SantanaDisplay.tech</tt>
    </blockquote>
    </dl>

    <p>
    The ability to read the Lisp/Skill file format used by Virtuoso
    is provided by an internal <a href="lisp">Lisp parser</a>.  The
    parser is available to run general scripts through the
    <a href="!lisp"><b>!lisp</b></a> command, though this has limited
    utility at present.

    <p>
    In the technology file, is is sometimes useful to enable debugging
    output from the Lisp parser.  The following keyword enables this.

    <a hame="LispLogging"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>LispLogging</tt> [<tt>y/n</tt>]<dd>
    If this boolean keyword is set in the technology file, a <a
    href="xic:logs">log file</a> will be generated when the Lisp
    parser is used.  This can be used to track down issues when
    parsing Virtuoso-style input files.  Asserting this keyword is
    equivalent to setting the Lisp logging in the
    <href="xic:dblog"><b>Logging Options</b></a> panel from the
    <b>Help Menu</b>, which otherwise can't be done before the
    technology file is read on program startup.

    <p>
    The logging output is put into a file named
    <i>filename</i><tt>-lisp.log</tt> in the logfiles directory.  The
    <i>filename</i> is the name of the input file being parsed.

Technology File Comments
!!HTML
    The technology file recognizes a <tt>Comment</tt> keyword.  These
    lines have no effect, but are saved and included when the file is
    written with the <b>Save Tech</b> command.  Thus, notes about the
    file can be preserved.  An attempt is made to to place the comment
    in the same relative position during an update.

    <p>
    Comments can also be included in the technology file after the '#'
    character or '//' sequence, however these comments will not appear
    in a file written with the <b>Save Tech</b> command.

    <p>
    Example:
      <blockquote><tt>
      Comment  Technology file Ultra-MOS version 3.5<br>
      Comment  Version 1.3  March 24, 2002  George H. Frump

    </td></tr></table>

    <p>
    In order to facilitate customization of the technology file to
    different variations, in particular to support scalable
    technology, a macro facility is provided, along with an expression
    evaluator.  Macros can be used to simplify or clarify the
    constructs used in the technology file, and facilitate portability
    by effectively customizing the technology file to different
    environments.

    <p>
    The macro capability makes use of the generic <a
    href="macro">macro preprocessor</a> provided in <i>Xic</i>.  The
    reader should refer to this section for a full description of the
    preprocessor capabilities.  The preprocessor provides a few
    predefined macros used for testing (and customizing for) release
    number, operating system, etc.  The keyword names, which
    correspond to the generic names as described for the macro
    preprocessor, are case-insensitive and listed in the following
    table.

    <blockquote>
    <table cellpadding=2 border=1 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><th>Keyword</th> <th>Function</th></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>Define</tt></td> <td>Define a macro.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>If</tt></td> <td>Conditional evaluated test.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>IfDef</tt></td> <td>Conditional definition test.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>IfnDef</tt></td> <td>Conditional non-definition test.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>Else</tt></td> <td>Conditional else clause.</td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>Endif</tt></td> <td>Conditional end clause.</td></tr>
    </table>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    A macro definition can appear anywhere in the technology file. 
    Throughout the technology file, each line is macro expanded.  The
    actual arguments replace the formal arguments (if any) in the
    substitution text, which replaces the macro reference.  The macro
    is recognized as a text token.

    <p>
    Example:

    <blockquote>
    <pre>
    Define  mytext(x)  this is rule number x
    ...
    MinWidth 2 # mytext(1.2)  
    </pre>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The <tt>MinWidth</tt> line expands to

    <blockquote>
    <tt>MinWidth 2 # this is rule number 1.2</tt>
    </blockquote>

    <a name="cond"></a>
    <p>
    The conditional keywords provide tests which can be used to select
    which lines of the technology file are actually read, based of the
    settings of existing macros and/or expression evaluation.  The
    logic is explained in the description of the generic macro
    preprocessor.

    <p>
    Example:

    <blockquote><tt>
    Define TightRules<br>
    ...<br>
    Layer M1<br>
    IfDef TightRules<br>
    MinWidth .4<br>
    Else<br>
    MinWidth .8<br>
    Endif<br>
    </tt></blockquote>

    <p>
    In the example above, commenting out the <tt>Define</tt> line
    <blockquote>
     #Define TightRules
    </blockquote>
     reconfigures the technology file.

    <p>
    When the technology file is updated with the <b>Save Tech</b>
    command, only the lines that were actually processed are written,
    i.e., the <tt>IfDef</tt>, etc.  lines and unused blocks are
    stripped.

    <a name="set"></a>
    <h2>The <tt>Set</tt> Keyword:  Variable Substitution</h2>

    A different type of macro is defined using the <tt>Set</tt>
    keyword, where the words following are parsed into three tokens
    <blockquote>
    <tt>Set</tt> <i>name</i> <tt>=</tt> <i>value</i>
    </blockquote>

    This type of macro is referred to by

    <blockquote>
    <tt>$(</tt><i>name</i><tt>)</tt>
    </blockquote>

    which is replaced by <i>value</i> as the file is read.  If the
    <i>name</i> has not been assigned in a <tt>Set</tt> line, but an
    environment variable by that name is found, the substitution will
    be made from the value of the environment variable.  Otherwise,
    the variable must be set before being referenced, meaning that the
    <tt>Set</tt> line must appear before the first reference in the
    technology file.

    <p>
    Neither the <i>name</i> or <i>value</i> tokens can contain a
    carriage return, though they can contain embedded white space.  In
    either case, the beginning and end of the token is the first and
    last non-white character.  Substitution is performed recursively. 
    The two types of macro can be mixed, though the <tt>Set</tt> line
    is not expanded for <tt>Define</tt>'ed macros.  Other lines are
    first expanded for <tt>Define</tt>'ed macros, then for
    <tt>Set</tt> macros.

    <p>
    The <tt>Set</tt> keyword should not be confused with the <a
    href="techfile:set"><b>!set</b></a> command, which can also appear
    in the technology file.

    <a name="eval"></a>
    <h2>The <tt>eval</tt> Keyword: Expression Evaluation</h2>

    <p>
    An expression involving integers or floating point numbers can
    be evaluated as the file is read, with the result inserted into
    the line at the place of evaluation.  This facilitates, for
    example, the use of design rules based on the <i>lambda</i>
    concept.  In this type of rule set, design rules are specified
    in terms of a minimum dimension <i>lambda</i>.  The
    <i>lambda</i> may vary between different process
    implementations.  In the technology file, <i>lambda</i> is
    defined as a macro, and inputs to the design rule
    specifications is evaluated in terms of <i>lambda</i>.

    <p>
    The syntax for expression evaluation is
    <tt>eval(</tt><i>expression</i><tt>)</tt>.  This construct can
    occur anywhere in the text, although it makes sense only where a
    number is expected.  The result of the evaluation is substituted
    into the text replacing the <tt>eval</tt> construct, before that
    line of the technology file is interpreted.  The expression is
    interpreted by the parser otherwise used for interpreting command
    <a href="xicscript">scripts</a>, and the full complement of
    operations and functions is available.  Macros are expanded before
    the expression is parsed.

    <p>
    Example:

      <blockquote><tt>
      Set lambda = .6<br>
      ...<br>
      <br>
      PhysLayer BASE<br>
      MinWidth eval(2*$(lambda))  #Min width of BASE layer is 2*lambda
      </tt></blockquote>

    <p>
    In this example, the parameter <tt>lambda</tt> is defined to ".6"
    with the <tt>Set</tt> keyword.  Elsewhere in the file, design rules
    can be specified as functions of <tt>lambda</tt> using the
    <tt>eval</tt> construct, as shown.

    <p>
    Example:

      <blockquote><tt>
      Set lambda = .6<br>
      Define L(x) eval($(lambda)*x)<br>
      ...<br>
      <br>
      PhysLayer BASE<br>
      MinWidth L(2)  #Min width of BASE layer is L(2)
      </tt></blockquote>

    <p>
    In this example, the macro <tt>L(x)</tt> is used to hide the call
    to the evaluation function, simplifying syntax.

    <p>
    If the technology file is updated using the <b>Save Tech</b>
    command button, only the macros used in the design rule keywords
    will be preserved in their original macro form in the new file. 
    Elsewhere, the written lines will contain the expanded quantity. 
    All of the <tt>Set</tt> and <tt>Define</tt> lines will be
    preserved.  Thus, the use of macros should be restricted to the
    design rule keywords, unless the user is willing to hand edit the
    new files produced with the <b>Save Tech</b> command.

    Also typically appearing near the top of the technology file are
    the <b>!set</b> commands.
    <blockquote>
    <tt>!set</tt> <i>arguments</i>
    </blockquote>
    Unlike the <a href="techfile:macros#set"><tt>Set</tt></a> keyword,
    this directive assigns variables as if the keyboard <a
    href="!set"><b>!set</b></a> command, as used interactively from
    the prompt line, had been given.  The <i>arguments</i> are exactly
    as they would appear on the prompt line.  Thus, the command
    attributes that are controlled with the <b>!set</b> command can be
    specified in the technology file.  The technology file is read
    after the <tt>.xicinit</tt> and before the <tt>.xicstart</tt> <a
    href="initfiles">initialization file</a>, which are other options
    for executing the <b>!set</b> command at program startup.

    <p>
    This form is appropriate for variables that are defined by the
    user.  Variables that are known to <i>Xic</i> can presently be set
    <a href="techfile:attr:vars">as keywords</a>, though the form
    described here can be used as well.

    <p>
    When a new technology file is written with the <a
    href="xic:updat"><b>Save Tech</b></a> command, all <b>!set</b>
    lines from the original technology file (if any) are written as a
    block, but commented out.  This is followed by another block
    containing all of the currently defined variables, except for
    those known to <i>Xic</i> that can be set as keywords.  These
    include the path variables, and are written as keyword definitions
    elsewhere in the file.  The present listing will contain variables
    defined by the user.  These lines are active.  The user can edit
    these blocks as necessary.

    <p>
    The <a href="!attrvars"><b>!attrvars</b></a> command generates a
    listing of the variables that can be set as technology file
    keywords.

    There are four search paths that may be specified.  In each case,
    the path specification consists of a keyword, followed by the
    path.  The format of the path is described in the section
    detailing the <i>Xic</i> <a href="xicpaths">search paths</a>.

    <p>
    In the path defaults below, if the <a

    library</a> (default name "<tt>model.lib</tt>").  This path can
    also be set with the environment variable <a
    href="XIC_LIB_PATH"><b>XIC_LIB_PATH</b></a>, and a specification
    in the technology file will override an environment specification. 
    Unlike other search paths, the current directory is always checked

Technology File Scripts
!!HTML
    Scripts can be included in the technology file.  These scripts can
    appear as buttons in the <a href="xic:usermenu"><b>User
    Menu</b></a>, as with other scripts, or they can be "run once"
    scripts.  This feature is useful for including simple
    technology-specific commands, such as those that create special
    extraction layers or physical features.  Scripts defined in the
    technology file, however, can not be loaded into the debugger. 

    <p>
    A script is included in the technology file as follows.  The
    <tt>Script</tt> keyword is followed by the text which will
    appear in the command button.  If the button text contains white
    space, it must be quoted, e.g.,

    <blockquote>
    <tt>Script "My Cell Counter"</tt>
    </blockquote>

    The lines of the script follow, and the script text must be
    terminated with the keyword "<tt>EndScript</tt>" on a separate
    line.

    <blockquote>
    <tt>Script</tt> <i>menu_label</i><br>
    <i>script text</i><br>
    ...<br>
    <tt>EndScript</tt>
    </blockquote>

    If the line
    <blockquote>
    <tt>RunScript</tt>
    </blockquote>
    appears anywhere after the <tt>Script</tt> line and before
    <tt>EndScript</tt>, the script is taken as a "run once" script. 
    It will not be added to the <b>User Menu</b>.  Instead, it will be
    executed after the technology file has been read, then discarded. 
    Any number of scripts can be treated this way, they execute in
    order of appearance in the technology file.

    <p>
    Scripts defined in the technology file have lower priority than
    other scripts in the event of a menu label text clash.  Thus,
    technology file scripts will be "hidden" by other scripts with the
    same menu label, should any exist.

Technology File Layer Blocks
!!HTML
    <a name="MapLayer>"</a>
    <i>Xic</i> maintains a table of layer aliases, which can be used
    instead of the actual layer name where a layer entry is required. 
    This follows the Virtuoso "<tt>techParams</tt>" definitions where
    the value is a layer name.  The alias name is intended to be a
    generic name such as "<tt>active_layer</tt>", or
    "<tt>nwell_layer</tt>", which can be used in <a
    href="ext:device_block">device blocks</a> and elsewhere to provide
    a degree of process independence.  Further, some of these names
    may be specific to Virtuoso, and be handled in special ways.  The
    only example of this at present is handling of
    "<tt>active_layer</tt>".

    <p>
    Each line of the layer alias list takes the following form.
    <blockquote>
    <tt>MapLayer</tt> <i>alias</i> <i>layer_name</i>
    </blockquote>
    The <i>layer_name</i> must be resolvable as an <i>Xic</i>
    layer.

    <dl>
    <tt>active_layer</tt> alias handling<dd>
    If a layer alias named "<tt>active_layer</tt>" is given, as is at
    least one of the alias names "<tt>ngate_layer</tt>" and
    "<tt>pgate_layer</tt>", and the <tt>active_layer</tt> does not
    have a <a href="Conductor"><tt>Conductor Exclude</tt></a>
    directive, one will be created.  The excluded area is logically
    <tt>ngate_layer|pgate_layer</tt>.  This supports correct
    MOS device recognition when technology data are obtained
    exclusively from Virtuoso.
    </dl>

    <p>
    <a name="DefineLayer"></a>
    <a name="DefinePurpose"></a>
    The component layer names and numbers, and purpose names and
    numbers, are specified in optional tables.  These tables must
    appear before any <i>Xic</i> layer definitions.  A layer name or
    purpose name used by an <i>Xic</i> layer that is not found in a
    table will be created, and assigned a number by <i>Xic</i>.  The
    tables ensure a strict and repeatable correspondence between names
    and numbers, which may be necessary for compatibility with other
    tools.

    <p>
    The tables consist of lines in the following form:
    <blockquote>
    <tt>DefineLayer</tt> <i>layer_name</i> <i>layer_number</i><br>
    <tt>DefinePurpose</tt> <i>purpose_name</i> <i>purpose_number</i>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Name strings may contain alphanumeric characters plus the dollar
    sign ('<tt>$</tt>') and underscore ('<tt>_</tt>').  The numbers
    can be any value representable with 32-bits, except that -1 is
    reserved.  Be aware that other tools may define ranges of values
    that are reserved for internal use.

    <p>
    Following the layer and purpose tables, if any, <i>Xic</i> layers
    may be defined.  There are separate definitions of layers used in
    electrical (schematic) mode, and in physical mode (for layouts). 
    <i>Xic</i> maintains a standard set of electrical layers, in a
    standard order.  These will be created if the definitions do not
    appear in the technology file (or no technology file is read). 
    The SCED layer, which is the electrically-active wiring layer, is
    always first.  The user can modify the presentation attributes,
    and add layers as desired.  For physical mode, there are no such
    layers, all layers must be defined in some manner.

    <p>
    The separation of electrical and physical layers is a bit of an
    anachronism, and in current <i>Xic</i> releases a user-defined
    layer can actually exist in both electrical and physical layer
    tables.  This accommodates technologies imported from other tools,
    such as Cadence Virtuoso, where no such distinction is made.

    <p>
    Each layer definition starts with the keyword <tt>PhysLayer</tt>
    for physical layers or <tt>ElecLayer</tt> for electrical layers,
    followed by a <a href="layername">name</a>.  Both of these
    keywords have synonyms (listed below) for backwards compatibility. 
    The name should be a valid layer name, though an attempt is made
    to use invalid names if possible by editing out unacceptable
    characters.

    <p>
    Layer blocks appear in a contiguous section in the technology
    file, and in physical mode will appear in the layer table in the
    order given.  In electrical mode, reordering may be applied, as
    there are some internal assumptions.

    <p>
    A layer block is terminated by the start of another layer block,
    or by a keyword which would logically end per-layer parsing.

    <a name=ElecLayer></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>ElecLayer</tt> <i>name</i>
    <dd>This keyword specifies the beginning of the layer block for
    the electrical layer <i>name</i>.  The keyword
    <tt>ElecLayerName</tt> is a synonym.
    </dl>

    <a name=PhysLayer></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>PhysLayer</tt> <i>name</i>
    <dd>This keyword specifies the beginning of the layer block for
    the physical layer <i>name</i>.  Layers will appear in the
    physical mode layer table in the order given.  The keywords
    <tt>PhysLayerName</tt>, <tt>Layer</tt>, and <tt>LayerName</tt> are
    all synonyms for this keyword.
    </dl>

    <a name=DerivedLayer></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>DerivedLayer</tt> <i>name</i> [<tt>join|split|splitv</tt>]
      <i>expression</i>
    <dd>
    This line provides a definition of a <a href="drvlayer">derived
    layer</a>.  Derived layers represent an expression of other
    layers, derived and normal physical, which can be referenced in <a
    href="layer_exp">layer expressions</a>.  Derived layers were
    introduced in support of the <a href="drcrules">design rule</a>
    checking system, but can be accessed for other purposes through a
    script function <a href="funcs:geom1:drvlyr">interface</a>.

    <p>
    This will add a derived layer to the database, under the name
    given in the first token.  The remainder of the line is the layer
    expression.  The expression is not parsed until evaluation time.

    <p>
    When the derived layer is evaluated, the geometry can appear as an
    assemblage of trapezoids if either of the <tt>split</tt> or
    <tt>splitv</tt> keywords is given, or alternatively as a minimal
    number of complex polygons if the <tt>join</tt> keyword is given
    instead.  If <tt>splitv</tt> is given, a vertical orientation is
    favored for the decomposition, whereas similarly <tt>split</tt>
    will produce a decomposition favoring a horizontal orientation. 
    The default is the joined form if none of these optional keywords
    is given, except when simply copying from another layer in which
    case the default is to copy objects without change.  The keyword
    "<tt>splith</tt>" is a synonym for "<tt>split</tt>".
    </dl>

    <p>
    These lines begin a layer block description, and any of the
    keywords which can apply to physical layers can be used in the
    derived layer blocks, though the definitions may be useless. 
    Layer block keywords that are significant are listed below.

    <ol>
    <li> Design rules.  These rules will be evaluated while doing
    design rule checking.  As further described in the in the <a
    href="drcrules">DRC description</a>, there are some types of tests
    that require use of derived layers.

    <li>When a new normal layer is created as a copy of a derived
    layer, which can be done with the <a
    href="!layer"><b>!layer</b></a> command, or with the <a
    href="xic:lexpr"><b>Layer Expression Evaluation</b></a> panel from
    the <b>Edit Menu</b>, or with the <a
    href="Layer"><tt>Layer</tt></a> script function, the new layer
    will inherit the attributes of the derived layer.  This includes
    color, fill pattern, GDSII mpping, and other flags and properties. 
    This gives purpose to the definitions provided in the derived
    layer block.
    </ol>
    </dl>

    <p>
    The topics from the table below categorize and describe the fairly
    lengthly list of per-layer keywords.  All of the keywords are
    optional, and can appear under an electrical or physical layer,
    unless stated otherwise.  Many of these keywords can be programmed
    from within <i>Xic</i> with the <a href="xic:lpedt"><b>Tech
    Parameter Editor</b></a> from the <b>Attributes Menu</b>.  Other
    panels from the <b>Attributes Menu</b> allow setting colors, fill
    patterns, etc.  which correspond to values from keywords.

    <p>
    In the syntax descriptions, the italicized quantities represent
    data the needs to be provided.  The "<tt>y</tt>|<tt>n</tt>" symbol
    implies that one of '<tt>y</tt>' or '<tt>n</tt>' can follow the
    keyword.  Actually, '<tt>0</tt>' (zero), or any word that begins
    with the letters or sequence (case insensitive) '<tt>n</tt>',
    '<tt>f</tt>', '<tt>of</tt>' is taken as a false value.  Anything
    else, including no following text, is taken as true ('<tt>y</tt>'
    is always redundant).

Technology File Layer Block Keywords:  Misc. Attributes
!!HTML
    These miscellaneous keywords apply bits of information to the
    layer, which affects behavior in situations described.

    <a name=LppName></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>LppName</tt> <i>name</i>
    <dd>This provides an optional alias for the layer/purpose pair
    that represents the <i>Xic</i> layer name.  The <i>Xic</i> layer
    can be accessed by this alias, in addition to the normal name.  If
    no non-space characters are found after the keyword, the statement
    is ignored.  Any character is allowed in the alias name, but
    leading and training white space is removed, and inclusion of some
    characters, for example a colon ('<tt>:</tt>'), can definitely
    cause trouble.
    </dl>

    <a name=Description></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Description</tt> <i>description_string</i>
    <dd>This will set the description field of the current layer.  If
    no non-space characters are found after the keyword, the statement
    is ignored.  Leading and training white space is removed from the
    description string.
    </dl>

    <a name="NoSelect"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>NoSelect</tt> [<tt>y</tt>|<tt>n</tt>]
    <dd>If this keyword appears, and any following argument indicates
    true, objects on the layer can not be selected.  The selectability
    status of the layers can be changed from the <a
    href="layertab">layer table</a>.
    </dl>

    <a name="NoMerge"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>NoMerge</tt> [<tt>y</tt>|<tt>n</tt>]
    <dd>This keyword indicates that automatic merging of objects is
    suppressed on the layer.  This overrides any merging enabled by
    the <b>Merge new boxes and polys with existing boxes/polys</b> and
    <b>Clip and merge new boxes only, not polys</b> check boxes in the
    <a href="xic:edset"><b>Editing Setup</b></a> panel from the
    <b>Edit Menu</b>, and the <b>Clip and merge overlapping boxes</b>
    button in the <a href="xic:rdprm"><b>Set Import Parameters</b></a>
    panel from the <b>Convert Menu</b>, and the corresponding variables.
    </dl>

    <a name="WireActive"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>WireActive</tt> [<tt>y</tt>|<tt>n</tt>]
    <dd>If this keyword appears, and any following argument indicates
    true, wires on the layer will be considered for wire connectivity
    in schematics.  This flag is always set implicitly in the
    <tt>SCED</tt> layer.  The Cadence compatibility system may create
    a layer named <tt>wire</tt> with purpose <tt>drawing</tt> which
    will have this flag set.
    </dl>

    <a name="Symbolic"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Symbolic</tt> [<tt>y</tt>|<tt>n</tt>]
    <dd>This keyword indicates that the layer will not be shown in the
    display produced by the <a href="xic:csect"><b>Cross
    Section</b></a> command (in the <b>View Menu</b>).  Otherwise, it
    doesn't have any purpose in <i>Xic</i>, but might be useful to the
    user as a flag to indicate a non-physical layer.
    </dl>

    <a name="Invalid"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Invalid</tt> [<tt>y</tt>|<tt>n</tt>]
    <dd>If this keyword appears, and any following argument indicates
    true, the layer will not appear in the layer table, but will exist
    internally and resolve any references to the layer in a design. 
    Such layers are invisible, as the redisplay involves cycling
    through layers in the layer table.

    <p>
    This is for compatibility with Cadence Virtuoso, whose layer
    presentation attributes include a <tt>Valid</tt> flag.  When
    reading a Virtuoso technology file, if a layer is invisible, not
    selectable, and is invalid, the <i>Xic</i> <tt>Invalid</tt> flag
    will be set.

Technology File Layer Block Keywords:  Presentation
!!HTML
    These keywords impact the appearance of objects on the layer
    on-screen and in prints.

    <a name=RGB></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>RGB</tt> <i>colorspec</i>
    <dd>This keyword will set the color used to render objects on
    the layer.  on-screen.  The <i>colorspec</i> string is the name
    of a color or an RGB triple:
    <ul>
    <li>The name of a color.  The recognized names can be listed from
       the <a href"xic:color"><b>Set Color</b></a> pop-up in the
       <b>Attributes</b> menu with the <b>Colors</b> button.

    <li>Three space-separated numbers, each 0-255, representing the
       red, green, and blue intensity.  E.g., "196 240 235".

    <li>Other forms recognized by the <tt>XParseColor</tt> C library
       function, including "<tt>#RRRRGGGGBBBB</tt>" and
       "<tt>rgb:RRRR/GGGG/BBBB</tt>".  Here, <tt>R</tt>, <tt>G</tt>,
       and <tt>B</tt> are single hexadecimal digits.
    </ul>
    If the color is given as a name, the color will be converted to
    its RGB values if the file is updated.  If no <tt>RGB</tt> keyword
    is given for a layer, <i>Xic</i> will assign a random color.  The
    <tt>RGB</tt> keyword is allowed in the mini-layer blocks found in
    the print driver specifications.
    </dl>

    <a name=Filled></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Filled</tt> [<tt>y</tt>[...]]
    <dt><tt>Filled</tt> <tt>n</tt>[...] [<tt>o, f, c</tt>]
    <dt><tt>Filled</tt> <i>bit_data</i> [<tt>o, y, c</tt>]
    <dd>This keyword sets the fill and outline style used to render
    objects on the layer.  The tokens (other than <i>bit_data</i>) can
    be words starting with the indicated letters, or just the
    letters themselves, e.g., "<tt>n</tt>", "<tt>no</tt>", and
    "<tt>none</tt>", are equivalent.  This is case-insensitive.

    <p>
    If no tokens follow the keyword, or the first token starts with
    '<tt>y</tt>', solid fill will be used.  Additional tokens on the
    line will be ignored.

    <p>
    If the first token starts with '<tt>n</tt>', no fill pattern
    (empty fill) will be used.  In this case, there are three outline
    styles available:

    <ol>
    <li>A thin solid line boundary.
    <li>A thin dashed line boundary.
    <li>A thick solid line boundary for Manhattan boxes and polygons,
    and a thin solid line boundary for other objects.
    </ol>

    <p>
    There is also the "cut" attribute, where diagonal lines are drawn
    over boxes, forming an X.  This applies to boxes only, not wires
    or polygons, even though they may be rendered as four-sided
    rectangular figures.

    <p>
    Any text that follows the word that started with '<tt>n</tt>' is
    examined for the presence of the characters '<tt>o</tt>',
    '<tt>f</tt>', and '<tt>c</tt>'.  These can be found as individual
    letters or parts of words, for example "<tt>outline cut</tt>" and
    "<tt>oc</tt>" and "<tt>o c</tt>" are all equivalent.  In addition,
    this is all case-insensitive.

    <p>
    If neither '<tt>o</tt>' or '<tt>f</tt>' is found, a thin solid
    outline (style 1) is used.  If '<tt>o</tt>' is found but not
    '<tt>f</tt>', a thin dashed line (style 2) is used.  If
    '<tt>f</tt>' is found, with or without '<tt>o</tt>', then a thick
    solid line is used for edge segments of Manhattan objects, and a
    thin solid line is used for non-Manhattan objects (style 3).

    <p>
    In any case, if '<tt>c</tt>' is found, the "cut" attribute is
    applied.  If '<tt>o</tt>' is also found but not '<tt>f</tt>', the
    diagonals are shown as dashed lines, the same as the boundary. 
    Otherwise, the diagonals are always thin solid lines.

    <p>
    The form on the third line is used to specify a stipple pattern
    to use for fill.  <i>Xic</i> supports any stipple map size with
    the x and y dimensions in the range of 2-32.  However, <i>Xic</i>
    releases prior to 3.2.25 supported only 8x8, 8x16, 16x8, and 16x16
    maps.  The format described here is generally not backwards
    compatible with these releases.

    <p>
    Maps can be read as hex numbers, or as ASCII tokens, but not in
    the same line.  When <i>Xic</i> writes a technology file, the
    default is to use the ASCII token format, which actually renders
    the map in a crude way.  This format is best illustrated by an
    example:

    <blockquote>
    <pre>
    Filled \
    &nbsp;&nbsp;|   ..   |  (0x18) \
    &nbsp;&nbsp;|  ....  |  (0x3c) \
    &nbsp;&nbsp;| ...... |  (0x7e) \
    &nbsp;&nbsp;|...  ...|  (0xe7) \
    &nbsp;&nbsp;|...  ...|  (0xe7) \
    &nbsp;&nbsp;| ...... |  (0x7e) \
    &nbsp;&nbsp;|  ....  |  (0x3c) \
    &nbsp;&nbsp;|   ..   |  (0x18) outline
    </pre>
    </blockquote>

    The points to note here are the following.
    <ol>
    <li>Line continuation is used so that the map is visible to a
    human reader.  This is not required in general.

    <li>Each line of the map contains space and non-space characters,
    surrounded by '|' characters.  Although a period is used here, any
    non-space printing character will work.

    <li>Each of these must contain the same number of characters, this
    number being in the range 2-32.  This sets the width of the map.

    <li>The number of these constructs found in the line sets the height
    of the map.  This must be in the range 2-32.

    <li>The map data parser ignores anything enclosed in parentheses.
    Above, the equivalent hex number for the data pattern is provided,
    but is ignored by the parser.
    </ol>

    <p>
    An equivalent form using hex data is

    <blockquote>
    [<tt>x=</tt><i>width</i>] [<tt>y=</tt><i>height</i>] <i>hex_number</i>
      <i>hex_number</i> ...
    </blockquote>

    The <i>width</i> and <i>height</i> are decimal numbers in the range
    2-32.  The number of hex digits that follow must match the <i>height</i>.

    <p>
    The width and height specifications can be omitted, in which case the
    format reverts to the pre-3.2.25 expectation.  The hex numbers must be
    one of
    <ul>
    <li>8 2-digit hex numbers that specify an 8x8 map.
    <li>16 2-digit hex numbers that specify an 8x16 map.
    <li>8 4-digit hex numbers that specify a 16x8 map.
    <li>16 4-digit hex numbers that specify a 16x16 map.
    </ul>

    <p>
    Additional text on the line is examined for the '<tt>o</tt>',
    '<tt>f</tt>', and '<tt>c</tt>' characters as described above for
    the no-fill case.  With a fill pattern, the interpretation is
    slightly different, as there is no dashed line outline available
    in this case.  If neither '<tt>o</tt>' or '<tt>f</tt>' appear, the
    pattern will not be outlined.  If '<tt>o</tt>' appears without
    '<tt>f</tt>', a thin solid outline will be used.  If '<tt>f</tt>'
    appears, edges of boxes and Manhattan polygons will be thick.  The
    '<tt>c</tt>' will draw diagonals on boxes.  For historical
    reasons, the character '<tt>y</tt>' is treated the same as
    '<tt>o</tt>'.
  
    <p>
    If the boolean variable <a
    href="TechNoPrintPatMap"><tt>TechNoPrintPatMap</tt></a> is set
    when <i>Xic</i> writes a technology file, then the hex form will
    be used to specify fill patterns.  Otherwise, the ASCII form is
    used.

    <p>
    Here are a few more example fill specifications:
    <blockquote><tt>
    Filled y<br>
    Filled no fat<br>
    Filled cc aa cc aa cc aa cc aa outline
    </tt></blockquote>

    In electrical mode, the SCED layer defaults to solid fill, and
    other layers default to empty fill with a thin outline.  All
    layers default to empty fill with a thin outline in physical mode. 
    The <tt>Filled</tt> keyword is allowed in the mini-layer blocks
    found in the print driver specifications.
    </dl>

    <a name="Invisible"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Invisible</tt> [<tt>y</tt>|<tt>n</tt>]
    <dd>If this keyword appears, and any following argument indicates
    true, the layer will not be visible, though it will appear in the
    layer table, where the visibility status can be changed.

    <p>
    The <tt>Invisible</tt> keyword is allowed in the mini-layer blocks
    found in the print driver specifications.  This is the only place
    where use of the <tt>y</tt>|<tt>n</tt> argument may be needed, in
    particular if <tt>Invisible</tt> is specified in the main layer
    block, <tt>Invisible n</tt> may be used in the driver block to
    make the layer visible in print driver output.
    </dl>

    <a name="Blink"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Blink</tt> [<tt>y</tt>|<tt>n</tt>]
    <dd>If this keyword appears, the layer color will oscillate
    between two shades with a 0.5 second period.  This is only
    supported in pseudo-color (usually 256 colors) graphics
    mode.<br>
    Default: not blinking
    </dl>

    <a name="NoInstView"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>NoInstView</tt> [<tt>y</tt>|<tt>n</tt>]
    <dd>If this keyword appears, and any following argument indicates
    true, objects on the layer will not be shown in electrical
    instances of the containing cell.  However they will appear when
    the cell is the current cell.  This is ignored in physical node.
    </dl>

    <a name="WireWidth"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>WireWidth</tt> <i>width</i>
    <dd>This keyword can appear in physical layer fields.  The
    width is a floating point number which sets the default wire
    width to that value in microns.  This value will be used when
    wires are created in <i>Xic</i>.<br>
    Default: 0

    <a name="CrossThick"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>CrossThick</tt> <i>thickness</i>

    This keyword, which can be applied to physical layers only, sets

!!TITLE
Technology File Layer Block Keywords:  Conversion
!!HTML
    The following keywords set the <a href="gdslayer">layer
    mapping</a> for GDSII and OASIS format input and output.  These
    can be programmed from within <i>Xic</i> with the <a
    href="xic:lpedt"><b>Tech Parameter Editor</b></a> in the <a
    href="xic:attrmenu"><b>Attributes Menu</b></a>.

    <a name="StreamData"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>StreamData</tt> <i>layernum datatype</i>
    <dd>This keyword is deprecated, and can be read but is not
    generated by <i>Xic</i>.  The <i>layernum</i> and <i>datatype</i>
    are the layer mapping used when converting to and from GDSII
    format.  The layer must be in the range 0 through 65535, and the
    datatype can take values -1 through 65535.  Values larger than 255
    are outside of the GDSII specification, but are sometimes used
    anyway although files containing such data may not be generally
    portable.  If -1 is given as the datatype, all GDSII datatypes
    will be mapped to the present <i>Xic</i> layer, and datatype 0
    will be used for output.  Otherwise, the layer and datatype in a
    GDSII file must match those given for successful mapping to the
    <i>Xic</i> layer.  Note that often the end of range values are
    reserved in other CAD environments, and that some releases of the
    GDSII format support only 64 layers and datatypes.  The datatype
    is used by <i>Xic</i> only in conjunction with the
    <tt>NoDrcDatatype</tt> keyword, and is otherwise typically set to
    0.  This keyword has been superseded by <tt>StreamIn</tt> and
    <tt>StreamOut</tt>.
    </dl>

    <a name="StreamIn"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>StreamIn</b> <i>layer_list</i> [, <i>datatype_list</i>]<dd>
    This keyword specifies a set of layer/datatype combinations that
    will map to the present <i>Xic</i> layer when reading GDSII and
    OASIS files.  Any number of such lines can be present.  The
    <i>layer_list</i> is a space-separated list of tokens, each of
    which is either a GDSII layer number ("32") or a range of numbers
    ("35-41").  The <i>datatype_list</i> is similarly constructed, and
    is optional.  The numbers in either list can range from 0 to
    65535, though numbers larger than 255 are outside of the GDSII
    specification (but sometimes used anyway).  If a
    <i>datatype_list</i> appears, it is separated from the
    <i>layer_list</i> with a comma.  The line specifies that each of
    the datatypes listed on each of the GDSII layers listed will be
    converted to the present <i>Xic</i> layer.  If the datatype list
    is absent, it defaults to "0-65535".  For example,
    <blockquote>
      <tt>StreamIn 5 7 8 21-30, 0 20-63</tt>
    </blockquote>
    specifies that datatypes 0 and 20-63 on GDSII layers 5, 7, 8, and
    21-30 will be mapped to the present <i>Xic</i> layer as a GDSII or
    OASIS file is read.  Note that GDSII layers cam be mapped to more
    than one <i>Xic</i> layer.  In this case, the geometry will be
    created on each of the <i>Xic</i> layers mapped to.

    <p>
    It is possible for more than one <i>Xic</i> layer to map from a
    given GDSII layer/datatype.  If the <a
    href="MultiMapOk"><b>MultiMapOk</b></a> variable is set, then
    multiple objects will be created when a GDSII or OASIS file is
    read, one on each matching <i>Xic</i> layer.  If this variable is
    not set, only the first mapping will be used, which will be the
    lowest matching layer found in the layer table.
    </dl>

    <a name="StreamOut"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>StreamOut</b> <i>out_layer</i> [<i>out_datatype</i>]<dd>
    This line specifies a layer/datatype combination to be used when
    generating GDSII and OASIS files for the present <i>Xic</i> layer. 
    One of these should appear for each <i>Xic</i> layer.  The
    <i>out_layer</i> and <i>out_datatype</i> can be in the range
    0-65535, though numbers larger than 255 are outside of the GDSII
    specification but are sometimes used anyway.  Be aware that use of
    numbers larger than 255 may render the file non-portable.  Note
    that often the end of range values are reserved in other CAD
    environments, and that some releases of the GDSII format support
    only 64 layers and datatypes.  The default datatype, if not given,
    is 0.

    <p>
    If there are more than one <b>StreamOut</b> lines given for a
    layer, and the <a href="MultiMapOk"><b>MultiMapOk</b></a> variable
    is set, the objects will be added to the GDSII or OASIS file on
    each of the GDSII layers/datatypes specified.  If the variable is
    not set, only the first <tt>StreamOut</tt> specification will be
    used.

    <p>
    There is no default for this keyword.
    </dl>

    <a name="NoDrcDatatype"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>NoDrcDatatype</b> <i>datatype</i><dd>
    If this keyword is given, then any object that has the given
    datatype will be ignored during <a href="xic:drcmenu">DRC</a>.  On
    output, objects that have their DRC <a href="xic:sflag">skip
    flags</a> set will be written with this datatype, and not the
    default datatype given in the <b>StreamOut</b> line.  The given

!!TITLE
Technology File Layer Block Keywords:  Extraction
!!HTML
    This section describes the keyword entries which appear in layer
    blocks categorize the purpose of the layer for extraction.  These
    define the conductor layers which are involved in grouping,
    identify vias between conductors, etc.  These keywords can appear
    only in physical layer fields.

    <p>
    All of these settings can be entered with the <a
    href="xic:lpedt"><b>Edit Tech Params</b></a> command in the <a
    href="xic:attrmenu"><b>Attributes Menu</b></a> and then written to
    disk with the <a href="xic:updat"><b>Save Tech</b></a> command in
    the <b>Attributes Menu</b>, or be entered with a text editor
    directly into the technology file.

    <p>
    Some of the keywords below use <a href="layer_exp">layer
    expressions</a>.  A layer expression in its simplest form is a
    layer name.  More generally, it consists of an expression
    involving layer names, the intersection operator (<tt>&</tt>), the
    union operator (<tt>|</tt>), and the inversion operator
    (<tt>!</tt>).  Parentheses can be used to enforce precedence. 
    These are the same type of expressions as used in the DRC tests. 
    The expression is "true" at points where the expression would
    return opacity.

    <a name="Conductor"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Conductor [Exclude</tt> <i>expression</i><tt>]</tt>
    <dd>This keyword indicates that the present layer is to be
    included in conductor net grouping.  If the keyword
    "<tt>Exclude</tt>" and a following <a href="layer_exp">layer
    expression</a> are given, the regions of the current layer under
    which the expression is true are clipped out for grouping
    purposes.  For example, in CMOS technology a transistor is formed
    by a strip of CAA (active area) bisected by a CPG (polysilicon)
    gate.  If "<tt>Conductor Exclude CPG</tt>" is given in the CAA
    layer block, the two pieces of CAA will be given separate group
    numbers, which is necessary to keep the transistor source and
    drain separate.
    </dl>

    <a name="Routing"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Routing</tt> [<i>route params</i>]
    <dd>This keyword implies that the layer is a conductor used for
    connecting between cells.  The <tt>Conductor</tt> keyword is
    implied, so that the <tt>Conductor</tt> keyword does not also have
    to be supplied, unless there is an <tt>Exclude</tt> directive. 
    Only layers with the <tt>Routing</tt> keyword given will be
    considered by the extraction system for connecting between cells,
    and cell formal terminals will only be assigned to
    <tt>Routing</tt> layers.  This is not absolute, however.  The
    extraction system will place formal terminals on
    <tt>Conductor</tt> layers under some circumstances, if necessary.

    <p>
    Optionally, routing parameter definitions may follow the keyword. 
    These provide information to a third-party auto-route system, The
    parameters are saved in the <i>Xic</i> technology database, and
    are used when writing a technology file, but are not otherwise
    used directly by <i>Xic</i>.  The recognized routing parameter
    definitions are listed below.  These can appear in any order. 
    These parameters will be parsed and set when reading the
    technology file, but can also be set when reading Cadence
    <a href="ReadCdsTech">ASCII technology files<a>.

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>dir=H|V|X|Y</tt>[...]<dd>
    This sets the preferred direction of routes on the layer.  The
    "<tt>dir=</tt>" is literal, and is followed by a letter or word,
    only the first letter of which is significant.  If the first letter
    is <tt>H</tt> or <tt>X</tt> (case insensitive), the route direction
    is horizontal.  If the letter is <tt>V</tt> or <tt>Y</tt>, also
    case insensitive) the routing direction is vertical.  Otherwise,
    an error ensues.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>p</tt>[<tt>itch</tt>]<tt>=</tt><i>px</i>[<tt>,</tt><i>py</i>]<dd>
    This provides the values for the route pitch.  Only the first letter
    of the "<tt>pitch</tt>" keyword need be present.  This is followed by
    an equal sign ("<tt>=</tt>"), and one or two real numbers.  The
    numbers are pitch values in microns.  If there are two numbers, the
    first is the horizontal pitch, the second vertical, separated by a
    comma.  Two numbers are required only if the horizontal and vertical
    pitch values differ.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>o</tt>[<tt>ffset</tt>]<tt>=</tt><i>ox</i>[<tt>,</tt><i>oy</i>]<dd>
    This provides values for the route offset, and is parsed the same
    way as the pitch.  The values are real numbers giving the offset
    in microns.  The second number can be omitted if it is the same as
    the first.  The offset is the routing grid origin relative to the
    cell origin.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>w</tt>[<tt>idth</tt>]<tt>=</tt><i>w</i><dd>
    This specifies the line width, in microns, used for routing. 
    Presently, only one number is accepted, implying that horizontal
    and vertical routes have the same width.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>maxd</tt>[<tt>ist</tt>]<tt>=</tt><i>d</i><dd>
    This provides a maximum route length, in microns.  A router may
    use this value to limit route lengths.
    </dl>
    </dl>

    <a name="GroundPlane"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>GroundPlane [Global]</tt>
    <dt><tt>GroundPlaneDark [Global]</tt> (alias)
    <dd>This keyword indicates that the present layer is to be treated
    as a clear-field <a href="ext:gplane">ground plane</a>.  The layer
    is given the <tt>Conductor</tt> attribute.  If the keyword
    "<tt>Global</tt>" appears, then every object on the layer will be
    assigned to the ground group 0.  This would be appropriate if the
    layer represents a diffusion rather than a metallic ground plane. 
    The default is to treat this level as a normal conductor, except
    that when this layer is grouped in the top-level cell, the group
    with the largest area is assigned to the ground group.

    <p>
    If "<tt>Global</tt>" is given, the <a
    href="GroundPlaneGlobal"><b>GroundPlaneGlobal</b></a> variable,
    which activates the mode, will be set.

    <p>
    Only one of the ground plane keywords can appear in the technology
    file.  Conductor group 0 is used only if a ground plane has been
    specified.  The ground plane layer can be referenced in
    <tt>Via</tt> and <tt>Contact</tt> lines just as any
    <tt>Conductor</tt>.
    </dl>

    <a name="GroundPlaneClear"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>GroundPlaneClear [MultiNet [0|1|2]]</tt>
    <dt><tt>TermDefault [MultiNet [0|1|2]]</tt> (alias)
    <dd>This keyword indicates that the present layer is to be treated
    as a dark-field ground plane.  These keywords imply
    <tt>DarkField</tt>.  Giving <tt>GroundPlane</tt> (or
    <tt>GroundPlaneDark</tt>) and <tt>DarkField</tt> is equivalent to
    <tt>GroundPlaneClear</tt> without <tt>MultiNet</tt>.

    <p>
    Only one of the ground plane keywords can appear in the technology
    file.  Conductor group 0 is used only if a ground plane has been
    specified.

    <p>
    Without the <tt>MultiNet</tt> keyword, connections to this layer
    (as specified with the <tt>Via</tt> and <tt>Contact</tt>
    keywords), where this layer does <i>not</i> appear, are considered
    as connections to ground (group 0).  Although this approach may
    work for simple cells, it can lead to trouble.  Suppose that an
    island of ground plane metal is used as part of the metalization
    for the chip pads.  This would appear as a hole in the displayed
    representation of the ground plane layer.  Then each pad will be
    extracted as shorted to ground!

    <p>
    There is provision for more intelligent handling of the
    <tt>GroundPlaneClear</tt> layer, allowing the layer to be included
    in paths and groups.  If the <tt>MultiNet</tt> keyword appears,
    the inverse of the layer is computed, and that (temporary) layer
    is used in the grouping.  However, it can take quite a lot of
    behind-the-scenes computation if the <tt>GroundPlaneClear</tt>
    layer has complex patterning.  Inversion is also done if the <a
    href="!set"><b>!set</b></a> variable <a
    href="GroundPlaneMulti"><b>GroundPlaneMulti</b></a> is given (note: 
    this variable was formerly named <tt>HandleTermDefault</tt>).  The
    temporary layer is treated as a clear-field ground plane, and all
    references to the ground plane will be applied to the temporary
    layer during grouping and extraction.

    <p>
    The name of the internal layer created is "<tt>$GPI</tt>".  By
    default, this layer is invisible.  It should not be directly
    edited by the user.  The inverse layer is an internal layer and is
    never written to a file during conversion or a save.  During
    extraction the <tt>GroundPlaneClear</tt> layer is ignored, and the
    inverse, which is a <tt>Conductor</tt>, is used to establish
    connectivity.

    <p>
    To establish connectivity for the commands in the <a
    href="xic:extmenu"><b>Extract Menu</b></a>, the inverse layer is
    created according to one of the algorithms described below.  An
    optional integer 0-2 may follow the <tt>MultiNet</tt> keyword,
    which indicates the algorithm used for inversion.  The algorithm
    can also be selected by setting the variable <a
    href="GroundPlaneMethod"><b>GroundPlaneMethod</b></a> to an
    integer in the same range, with the <b>!set</b> command.

    <dl>
    <dt>0<dd>
    The inverted layer is created for each cell in the hierarchy by
    computing
    <blockquote>
    <tt>$GPI = !<i>GP</i> & !$$</tt>
    </blockquote>
    i.e., for each cell the ground plane is inverted and the areas
    over subcells are removed (recall that "<tt>$$</tt>" is a
    pseudo-layer representing subcell boundaries).  This is the
    default.

    <dt>1<dd>
    The inverted layer is created only in the top cell in the
    hierarchy, and is the inverse of a flat representation of the
    ground plane layer from all cells in the hierarchy.  The
    extraction algorithm will add virtual contacts from this layer to
    the appropriate places in the subcells.

    <dt>2<dd>
    The inverted layer is created in each cell of the hierarchy by
    creating a flat inverse of all of the ground plane found in the
    cell or lower in the hierarchy.
    </dl>

    <p>
    The default (0) method is the most efficient computationally, but
    the method will probably fail if sibling subcells overlap.  In
    general, it is good practice to avoid cell overlap.

    <p>
    Method 1 will work if subcells overlap.  However, since there is
    no local ground plane in the subcells, generating a netlist while
    in a <a href="xic:push"><b>Push</b></a> will not yield correct
    results.

    <p>
    Method 2 is the least efficient computationally, but each cell has
    a local ground plane.
    </dl>

    <a name="Via"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Via</tt> <i>layer1 layer2</i> [<i>expression</i>]
    <dd>This keyword indicates that the present layer may provide
    connection points between wire nets on <i>layer1</i> and
    <i>layer2</i>.  The <i>layer1</i> and <i>layer2</i> are names of
    layers each of which have the <tt>Conductor</tt>,
    <tt>Routing</tt>, or one of the ground plane keywords specified. 
    In extraction, it is assumed that the via is formed by dark area
    on the present layer, and vias are completely covered by
    <i>layer1</i> and <i>layer2</i>.  A connection is indicated if the
    <i>expression</i> (which is a <a href="layer_exp">layer
    expresion</a>) is true at any point within the via.
    The <tt>Via</tt> keyword implicitly assigns "<tt>DarkField</tt>".
    The recognition logic is as follows:

    <p>
    <b>for each</b> <i>region</i> of the <b>Via</b> layer {<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;<b>if</b> (there exists an object on <i>layer1</i> that
     overlaps <i>region</i>)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>if</b> (there exists an object on <i>layer2</i>
     that overlaps <i>region</i>)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>if</b> (there is no
     <i>expression</i>, <b>or</b> the area where <i>expression</i> is true
     in<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
     <i>region</i> is nonzero)<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>then</b>
     the via indicates a connection between the two objects<br>
    }

    <p>
    If the <i>expression</i> is not given, it is always taken as "true".

    <p>
    Examples:
    <blockquote><tt>
    Via M1 M2 !RES
    </tt></blockquote>
    A via is indicated if part of the via object on the present layer
    which is being evaluated is not covered by objects on RES.

    <blockquote><tt>
    Via M1 M2 I2
    </tt></blockquote>
    A via is indicated if the via object on the present layer is
    partially or completely covered with I2.

    <blockquote><tt>
    Via M1 M2 (!I2)&(!RES)
    </tt></blockquote>
    A via is indicated if part of the via object is not covered by I2
    or by RES.
    </dl>

    <a name="Dielectric"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Dielectric</tt>
    <dd>This keyword is intended to specify an explicit capacitor
    dielectric, which is different from a <tt>Via</tt> layer.  A layer
    can not have both keywords.  This is primarily to support the
    capacitance extraction <a href="fcinterf">interface</a>.  A
    <tt>Dielectric</tt> layer is assumed to be clear-field, unlike
    <tt>Via</tt> layers, though the <tt>DarkField</tt> keyword can
    also be applied.  Also unlike <tt>Via</tt> layers,
    <tt>Dielectric</tt> layers are not assumed to be planarizing by
    default.
    </dl>

    <p>
    <a name="Contact"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt>Contact <i>layer</i> [<i>expression</i>]
    <dd>This keyword specifies that the present layer may be in
    contact with <i>layer</i>, which has the <tt>Conductor</tt>
    attribute, and is to be grouped accordingly in the wire net
    extraction.  The <i>expression</i> (which is a layer expression),
    if given, must be true in the overlap region between the object
    and the objects on <i>layer</i> for contact to be established.

    <p>
    The purpose is to account for a contact metalization which is
    applied over the normal wiring layers, which may itself be used
    for making connections.  The <tt>Contact</tt> keyword implies
    <tt>Conductor</tt>.  The <tt>Contact</tt> keyword should be given
    in the layer block of the contact metal layer.  It is not
    necessary (or desirable) to include a reciprocal <tt>Contact</tt>
    specification in the referenced layer's block.
    </dl>

    <p>
    <a name="DarkField"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt>DarkField
    <dd>This keyword indicates that the layer polarity on the chip is
    the reverse of that shown on-screen.  This is usually the case for
    via layers, for example, which are rendered as small squares to
    indicate the contact location, which is actually a hole in an
    insulating layer.  At present, the only command that uses this
    keyword is the <a href="xic:csect"><b>Cross Section</b></a>
    command in the <a href="xic:viewmenu"><b>View Menu</b></a>. 
    Layers with the keyword applied will be shown as on-chip in the
    cross sectional view.  This keyword is implicitly assigned by both
    <tt>Via</tt> and <tt>GroundPlaneClear</tt>.

    <p>
    The keyword has a secondary effect if used in conjunction with the
    <tt>GroundPlane</tt> (or the equivalent <tt>GroundPlaneDark</tt>)
    keyword.  The combination is equivalent to
    <tt>GroundPlaneClear</tt>.

!!TITLE
Technology File Layer Block Keywords:  Physical Properties
!!HTML
    The following keywords can appear only in physical layer fields,
    and they mostly specify physical material properties, or
    electrical parameters, used in various ways by the extraction
    system.

    <p>
    Many of these parameters are redundant or incompatible with each
    other.  Warning messages may be issued when incompatibilities are
    detected, however unused information is usually simply ignored and
    does no real harm.  In particular, there are two basic groups,
    those keywords that apply to condcutors, and those that apply to
    insulators.  Mixing these parameters on the same layer will likely
    generate a warning.

    <p>
    All of these settings can be entered with the <a
    href="xic:lpedt"><b>Edit Tech Params</b></a> command in the <a
    href="xic:attrmenu"><b>Attributes Menu</b></a> and then written to
    disk with the <a href="xic:updat"><b>Save Tech</b></a> command in
    the <b>Attributes Menu</b>, or be entered with a text editor
    directly into the technology file.

    <a name="Planarize"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Planarize</tt> [<tt>y</tt>|<tt>n</tt>]
    <dd>This specifies whether or not a layer is planarizing.  This is
    used by the three-dimensional layer sequence <a
    href="xic:ldb3d">generator</a> when creating layer sequences for
    the <a href="fcinterf">capacitance extraction</a> interface.  The
    <tt>Planarize</tt> keyword can be applied to prevent planarization
    of layers that are planarized by default, or to force planarizing
    of layers that don't normally have this property.  See the
    description of the sequence generator for a description of
    planarization, and which layers are planarized by default.
    </dl>

    <a name="Thickness"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Thickness</tt> <i>thickness</i>
    <dd>This keyword supplies the film thickness of the corresponding
    deposited film.  The <i>thickness</i> is given in microns.  This
    can be given to any physical layer.
    </dl>

    <a name="Sigma"></a>
    At most one of the following two keywords (<tt>Rho</tt> and
    <tt>Sigma</tt>) should be used.

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Rho</tt> <i>resistivity</i>
    <dd>This keyword supplies the resistivity, in MKS units
    (ohm-meters), of the corresponding conducting film.  If
    <tt>Rsh</tt> (below) and <tt>Thickness</tt> are both given, then
    the resistivity is already available and this keyword is
    redundant.  Supplying this keyword overrides the
    <tt>Rsh</tt>*<tt>Thickness</tt> value for the resistivity, when
    resistivity is used explicitly in the extraction system (in the <a
    href="fhinterf">inductance/resistance extraction interface</a>).
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Sigma</tt> <i>conductivity</i>
    <dd>This keyword supplies the conductivity, in MKS units
    (Si/meter), of the corresponding conducting film.  This is
    converted to resistivity (1.0/<i>conductivity</i>) internally,
    i.e., it is equivalent to giving <tt>Rho</tt>.
    </dl>

    <a name="Rsh"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Rsh</tt> <i>ohms_per_square</i>
    <dd>The single parameter is a floating point number giving the
    ohms per square value of the conducting material.  This is used in
    computation of the resistance value of resistor devices.  If
    <tt>Rho</tt> or <tt>Sigma</tt> is given, and also <tt>Thickness</tt>,
    then the sheet resistance is already available and this keyword is
    redundant.  Supplying this keyword overrides the
    <tt>Rho</tt>/<tt>Thickness</tt> value for sheet resistance.
    </dl>

    <a name="EpsRel"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>EpsRel</tt> <i>diel_constant</i>
    <dd>This keyword supplies the relative dielectric constant of
    insulating layers.
    </dl>

    <a name="Capacitance"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Capacitance</tt> <i>units_per_sqmicron</i>
       [<i>units_per_micron</i>]
    <dd>This enables computation of the capacitance of a conductor
    group on the present conducting layer.  The first parameter is a
    floating point number giving capacitance per square micron.  The
    optional second parameter (default 0) is the edge capacitance, per
    micron.  The extracted capacitance is the conductor group area
    multiplied by the first parameter, plus the conductor group
    perimeter length multiplied by the second parameter, if given. 
    The capacitance for each wire net is computed during extraction,
    and will be printed (if enabled) in the physical netlist output
    file.

    <p>
    The keyword "<tt>Cap</tt>" is accepted as an alias for
    "<tt>Capacitance</tt>".
    </dl>

    <a name="Lambda"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Lambda</tt> <i>pene_depth</i>
    <dd>This keyword specifies the London penetration depth of
    superconducting conductors, in microns.  When <tt>Lambda</tt> is
    given, <tt>Rho/Sigma</tt> (if given) represents the conductivity
    due to unpaired electrons from the two-fluid model.
    </dl>

    <a name="Tline"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Tline</tt> <i>grnd_plane_layer</i> [<i>diel_height</i>
      <i>diel_const</i>]
    <dd>This keyword will enable use of a microstrip model which
    computes transmission line parameters.  A microstripline geometry
    is assumed, with an object on the present layer forming a strip
    over an infinite ground plane layer, separated by a homogeneous
    dielectric of constant thickness.  No account is taken of "real"
    geometry, except for the dimensions of the strip on the present
    layer.

    <p>
    The first argument is the name of a layer assumed as the ground
    plane.  Both the present layer and the ground plane layer must be
    conductors and have <tt>Thickness</tt> and, if superconductors,
    <tt>Lambda</tt> defined.  Non-superconductors are treated as perfect
    conductors.

    <p>
    The second argument is the assumed height, in microns, of the
    intervening dielectric.  The third argument is the relative
    dielectric constant.  If either or both of these arguments is
    missing or given as "0" (zero), then <i>Xic</i> will search for a
    layer with the <a href="Via"><tt>Via</tt></a> keyword set that
    contains the present and the ground plane layers, and obtain the
    missing values from that layer.

    </dl>

    <a name="Antenna"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Antenna</tt> <i>float_value</i>
    <dd>
    This keyword applies to the <a href="!antenna"><b>!antenna</b></a>
    command, and is meaningful on conducting layers.  The
    <i>float_value</i> is a threshold antenna ratio, as explained for
    the <b>!antenna</b> command.  The value is effectively passed to
    that command as a default for the layer.

!!TITLE
Technology File Standard Via Definitions
!!HTML
    <i>Xic</i> provides support for OpenAccess/Virtuoso-style <a
    href="stdvia">standard vias</a>.  These definitions are imported
    from a Virtuoso ASCII technology file when the <a
    href="ReadCdsTech"><tt>ReadCdsTech</tt></a> is used to source a
    Cadence technology database, if any <tt>standardViaDefs</tt> nodes
    exist.  They will be written to and read from the <i>Xic</i>
    technology file using syntax described in this section.

    <p>
    Standard via definitions will be written following the derived
    layers when a new technology file is being created.  This is the
    recommended location when hand editing a technology file.  The
    definitions are required to follow the layer definition blocks of
    any layers used, but otherwise location in the technology file is
    flexible.

    <p>
    The syntax for a standard via definition is as follows.

    <blockquote>
    <tt>StandardVia</tt> <i>viaName layer1 layer2 cutLayer cutWidth
      cutHeight cutRows cutCols cutSpace_x cutSpace_y
      layer1Enc_x layer1Enc_y layer2Enc_x layer2Enc_y
      layer1Off_x layer1Off_y layer2Off_x layer2Off_y
      originOff_x originOff_y</i> [<i>implant1 imp1Enc_x imp1Enc_y</i>
      [<i>implant2 imp2Enc_x imp2Enc_y</i>]]
    </blockquote>

    The terms correspond to the options shown in the <a
    href="xic:crvia"><b>Via Creation</b></a> panel from the <b>Edit
    Menu</b>, and their effects are described in that section.  The
    definition must appear on a single logical line, but backslash
    line continuation can be employed to break the line for improved
    human readability.

    <p>
    The line must begin with the <tt>StandardVia</tt> keyword.  The
    remaining tokens are as follows.  All of the numerical values can
    be altered by the user before placement, the values provided in
    the definition are the initial defaults.  The layer names,
    however, can not be changed subsequently.  All dimensions are in
    microns.

    <dl>
    <dt><i>viaName</i><dd>
    This is a unique name for the standard via, and can be any text
    word that can be used as a cell name.  One convention is to
    use the layer names of the twe conductors, top conductor first,
    separated by an underscore (e.g., "<tt>M2_M1</tt>").
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><i>layer1 layer2 cutlayer</i><dd>
    The three tokens that follow are the names of the bottom
    conductor, the top conductor, and the via layer, in that order. 
    These layers must have been already defined in the technology
    file.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><i>cutWidth cutHeight</i><dd>
    These are floating-point numbers giving the size of the cut in
    microns.  The cut is always rectangular.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><i>cutRows cutCols</i><dd>
    These are integers not less than 1, which indicate that the cut
    should be arrayed according to the numbers of rows and colums
    given.  These are both usually 1 in a standard via definition,
    representing a minimum via.  The user can array the cuts when
    necessary from the <b>Via Creation</b> panel.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><i>cutSpace_x cutSpace_y</i><dd>
    These apply when the cut is arrayed, and provide the edge-to-edge
    space between cuts in the x and y direction.  This is usually
    a minimum value given by a design rule.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><i>layer1Enc_x layer1Enc_y layer2Enc_x layer2Enc_y</i><dd>
    These four dimensions provide the enclosure distance for the
    bottom (layer1) and top conductor rectangles relative to the cut. 
    The enclosure is the distance that the metal rectangle extends
    outside of the cut area.  This is usually a minimum value given by
    a design rule.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><i>layer1Off_x layer1Off_y layer2Off_x layer2Off_y</i><dd>
    These four dimensions provide offsets for the center of the two
    conductor rectangles relative to the center of the cut.  These
    values are unlikely to be other than zero.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><i>originOff_x originOff_y</i><dd>
    These coordinates provide the origin of the sub-master cell
    relative to the center of the cut array.  It is the location that
    corresponds to the mouse pointer when a new via instance is
    placed.  These are unlikely to be other than zero.
    </dl>

    All of the terms mentioned thus far are required.  The remaining
    terms are optional.

    <dt><i>implant1 imp1Enc_x imp1Enc_y</i><dd>
    This is the name of a layer followed by two dimensions.  If found,
    an additional rectangle of <i>implant1</i> is centered over the
    <i>layer1</i> (bottom conductor) rectangle.  The enclosure values
    specify the distance the implant extends outside of the conductor,
    in the x and y directions.
    </dl>

    <dt><i>implant2 imp2Enc_x imp2Enc_y</i><dd>
    These may follow an <i>implant1</i> group only.  This is the name
    of a layer followed by two dimensions.  If found, an additional
    rectangle of <i>implant2</i> is centered over the <i>layer2</i>
    (top conductor) rectangle.  The enclosure values specify the
    distance the implant extends outside of the conductor, in the x
    and y directions.
    </dl>

    Standard via definitions successfully read from the technology
    file will be saved internally, and the definitions can be accessed
    from the <b>Via Creation</b> panel.  The panel allows the default
    values to be overridden, and new vias to be created and placed. 
    If no stantard via definitions were successfully read, the panel
    is unavailable and the <b>Create Via</b> button in the <b>Edit
    Menu</b> is grayed.

    <p>
    In the syntax descriptions, the italicized quantities represent
    data the needs to be provided.  The "<tt>y</tt>|<tt>n</tt>" symbol
    implies that one of '<tt>y</tt>' or '<tt>n</tt>' can follow the

Technology File Attributes:  Grid Presentation
!!HTML
    These keywords define the appearance of the axes and grid shown in
    the drawing windows on program startup.  Within <i>Xic</i>, 
    the presentation can be modified from the <b>Style</b> page or the
    <a href="xic:grid"><b>Grid Setup</b></a> panels associated with
    the drawing windows.  The parameters given in the technology file
    apply to the main window, which are inherited by <a
    href="xic:vport">sub-windows</a> when created.  The parameters can
    subsequently be changed with the panel on a per-window basis.

    <p>
    For the main drawing window, the <b>Main Window</b> sub-menu of
    the <b>Attributes Menu</b> provides the <b>Set Grid</b> button,
    which brings up the <b>Grid Setup</b> panel.  <a
    href="xic:vport">Sub-windows</a> have the <b>Grid Setup</b> panel
    available from the <b>Attributes</b> menu in the sub-window.
    Pressing <b>Ctrl-g</b> while a drawing window has focus will also
    bring up the panel.

    <p>
    The keywords described in this section can also appear within <a
    href="hcopytech">print driver</a> blocks.  If they appear in a
    print driver block, the attribute will apply on-screen when that
    driver is active in printing mode, and in the printer output.

    <a name="Axes"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Axes [Plain | Mark | None]</tt>
    <dd>This determines the presentation style for the axes in
    physical mode.  The default is <tt>Mark</tt>, where the origin is
    marked with a small box.  If <tt>Plain</tt> is given, the axes are
    simple lines.  If <tt>None</tt> is given, the axes will not be
    drawn.
    </dl>

    <a name="ShowGrid"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>ShowGrid</tt> [<tt>y</tt>|<tt>n</tt>]
    <dd>This determines whether or not the grid will be shown by default,
    and applies to both physical and electrical modes.<br>
    Default: <tt>y</tt>
    </dl>

    <a name="ElecShowGrid"></a>
    <a name="PhysShowGrid"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>ElecShowGrid</tt> [<tt>y</tt>|<tt>n</tt>]
    <dt><tt>PhysShowGrid</tt> [<tt>y</tt>|<tt>n</tt>]
    <dd>These keywords allow the grid display to be set independently for
    the two modes.  The last <tt>ShowGrid</tt> directive will have precedence
    for a given mode.
    </dl>

    <a name="GridOnBottom"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>GridOnBottom</tt> [<tt>y</tt>|<tt>n</tt>]
    <dd>This keyword determines whether the grid is shown on top of or
    below the rendered objects.<br>
    Default: <tt>y</tt>
    </dl>

    <a name="ElecGridOnBottom"></a>
    <a name="PhysGridOnBottom"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>ElecGridOnBottom</tt> [<tt>y</tt>|<tt>n</tt>]
    <dt><tt>PhysGridOnBottom</tt> [<tt>y</tt>|<tt>n</tt>]
    <dd>These keywords allow the grid to be displayed above or below
    the rendered objects independently for the two modes.  The last
    <tt>GridOnBottom</tt> directive will have precedence for a given
    mode.
    </dl>

    <a name="GridStyle"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>GridStyle</tt> <i>style</i> [<i>xsize</i>] 
    <dd>This sets the style of grid to use in both electrical and
    physical modes.  The <i>style</i> is a decimal or hex (with
    "<tt>0x</tt>" prefix) integer whose binary pattern is used to
    replicate the grid lines.  A value of 0 indicates a point grid,
    and -1 indicates solid grid lines.  Other values are taken as a
    line pattern that is periodically reproduced.  From the MSB, the
    pattern starts with the first set bit, and continues through the
    LSB.<br>

    <p>
    If the <i>style</i> value is 0, for a "dots" grid, a second
    integer will be read if present.  This value can be 0-6, and
    represents the number of pixels to light up around the central
    pixel in the four compass directions.  The "dots" can appear as
    brighter dots or small crosses, as set by this integer.
    This integer is ignored if <i>style</i> is nonzero, and is taken
    as 0 if absent.<br>
    Default: 0xcc (hex)
    </dl>

    <a name="ElecGridStyle"></a>
    <a name="PhysGridStyle"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>ElecGridStyle</tt> <i>style</i>
    <dt><tt>PhysGridStyle</tt> <i>style</i>
    <dd>These keywords allow the grid style to be set independently
    for electrical and physical modes.  The last <tt>GridStyle</tt>
    directive has precedence for a given mode.
    </dl>

    <a name="CoarseGridMult"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>CoarseGridMult</tt> <i>num</i>
    <dd>This can be set to an integer 1-50, and specifies that coarse
    grid lines will appear every <i>num</i> fine grid lines.  With
    value 1, the grid will use the coarse grid color only.  This
    applies in both electrical and physical modes.<br>
    Default: 5
    </dl>

    <a name="ElecCoarseGridMult"></a>
    <a name="PhysCoarseGridMult"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>ElecCoarseGridMult</tt> <i>num</i>
    <dt><tt>PhysCoarseGridMult</tt> <i>num</i>
    <dd>These provide the coarse grid multiplier independently for the
    two modes.  The last <tt>CoarseGridMult</tt> directive seen for a
    given mode has precedence.

Technology File Attributes:  Misc. Presentation
!!HTML
    These keywords set initial values for a number of display
    attributes.  These generally apply to all drawing windows, but the
    values can be reset on a per-window basis within <i>Xic</i>.  For
    the main window, most have corresponding toggle buttons in the
    <b>Main Window</b> sub-menu of the <b>Attributes Menu</b>.  In <a
    href="xic:vport">sub-windows</a>, the buttons are located within
    the <b>Attributes</b> menu itself.

    <p>
    The keywords described in this section can also appear within <a
    href="hcopytech">print driver</a> blocks.  If they appear in a
    print driver block, the setting will apply on-screen when that
    driver is active in printing mode, and in the printer output.

    <a name="Expand"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Expand</tt> <i>num</i>
    <dd>This keyword sets the initial expansion level for subcells,
    for both electrical and physical modes.  If zero, no subcells are
    expanded.  If -1, all subcells will be shown expanded.  A positive
    integer indicates that subcells up to that depth will be shown
    expanded.<br>
    Default: 0

    <p>
    In <i>Xic</i>, the <a href="xic:expnd"><b>Expand</b></a> pop-up
    controls expansion level, on a per-window basis.  This panel is
    available from the <b>Expand</b> button in the main and sub-window
    <b>View</b> menus.

    <a name="DisplayAllText"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>DisplayAllText</tt> <i>num</i>
    <dd>This keyword sets whether label text is displayed or not, for
    both electrical and physical modes.  If <i>num</i> is 0, labels
    will not be displayed.  If 1 (actually, any number not 0 or 2),
    labels will be displayed in "legible" orientation.  If 2, labels
    will be shown in true orientation, i.e., rotated and mirrored as
    placed and transformed along with the containing instance.<br>

!!KEYWORD
techfile:attr:color
!!TITLE
Technology File Attributes:  Attribute Colors
!!HTML
    The following keywords set colors used on-screen and in printer
    output.  All of these keywords take a <i>colorspec</i> string as
    the argument list.  This is the name of a color or an RGB triple:

    <ul>
    <li>The name of a color.  The recognized names can be listed from
    the <a href"xic:color"><b>Set Color</b></a> pop-up in the
    <b>Attributes</b> menu with the <b>Colors</b> button.

    <li>Three space-separated numbers, each 0-255, representing the
    red, green, and blue intensity.  E.g., "196 240 235".

    <li>Other forms recognized by the <tt>XParseColor</tt> C library
    function, including "<tt>#RRRRGGGGBBBB</tt>" and
    "<tt>rgb:RRRR/GGGG/BBBB</tt>".  Here, <tt>R</tt>, <tt>G</tt>, and
    <tt>B</tt> are single hexadecimal digits.
    </ul>

    <p>
    Following the general pattern for the technology file keywords,
    the keyword form without the ``Phys'' or ``Elec'' prefix sets the
    color for both modes.  The mode-specific keywords set the color
    only for that mode.

    <p>
    A single internal data structure maintains all attribute
    (non-layer) colors.  All attribute colors can be set from the <a
    href="xic:color"><b>Color Selection</b></a> panel provided by the
    <b>Set Color</b> button in the <b>Attributes Menu</b>.  Attribute
    colors can also be changed with the <a
    href="!setcolor"><b>!setcolor</b></a> command.  In Unix/Linux,
    colors can be initialized from a <a href="resourcefile">resource
    file</a>, as well as from the technology file.

    <p>
    When <i>Xic</i> starts, the colors are set to default values. 
    Then, any colors found in a resource file are updated.  Then, some
    of the colors may be modified in the technology file.  Finally,
    the colors may be changed in a <a
    href="initfiles"><tt>.xicstart</tt> file</a>.

    <p>
    Below is the list of attribute colors, the defaults, and techfile
    keywords and aliases.  The <tt>SelectColor</tt>1/2 set the
    blinking highlighting used for selected objects.  Setting both to
    the same color stops the blinking.  The <tt>MarkerColor</tt> is
    used for electrical-mode terminal marks.  The <b>Plot Mark</b>
    colors are used only for the plot point indicators, and match the
    colors defined for plots in <i>WRspice</i>.

    <p>
    The <b>Prompt Line Colors</b> apply to the <a
    href="promptline">prompt line</a>, <a href="statusline">status
    area</a>, <a href="coordline">coordinate readout</a>, and main
    window <a href="keyspresd">keys-pressed area</a>.  The
    <tt>PromptBackgroundColor</tt> controls the common background
    color, except when the prompt line is in editing mode.  The other
    colors are self-explanatory, with the
    <tt>PromptHighlightingColor</tt> being the color used for <a
    href="hypertext">hypertext</a> entries (mostly for electrical
    mode).

    <p>
    The <b>Special GUI Colors</b> are miscellaneous colors used for
    highlighting and other purposes in the graphical user interface.

    These keywords define the grid and edge snapping parameters. 
    These can be reset from within <i>Xic</i> from the <b>Snapping</b>
    page of the <a href="xic:grid"><b>Grid Setup</b></a> panels
    associated with the drawing windows.  The parameters given in the
    technology file apply to the main window, which are inherited by
    <a href="xic:vport">sub-windows</a> when created.  The parameters
    can subsequently be changed with the panel on a per-window basis.

    <p>
    For the main drawing window, the <b>Main Window</b> sub-menu of
    the <b>Attributes Menu</b> provides the <b>Set Grid</b> button,
    which brings up the <b>Grid Setup</b> panel.  <a
    href="xic:vport">Sub-windows</a> have the <b>Grid Setup</b> panel
    available from the <b>Attributes</b> menu in the sub-window.
    Pressing <b>Ctrl-g</b> while a drawing window has focus will also
    bring up the panel.

    This keyword sets the initial state of the controls of the <b>Edge

    Only the first letter of the keywords is needed, and recognition is

!!TITLE
Technology File Attributes:  Function Keys
!!HTML
    It is possible to map the keyboard function keys to <i>Xic</i>
    operations.  The function key assignments are sensitive to the
    <b>Shift</b>, <b>Control</b>, and <b>Alt</b> keys.  This means
    that a function key (<b>F1</b> - <b>F12</b>) press can have
    different effects depending on the state of these keys.

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>F</tt><i>N</i><tt>Key</tt> <i>text</i>
    <dd>The <i>N</i> is an integer in the range 1-12, to correspond to
    the <b>F1</b> - <b>F12</b> function keys found on most keyboards.

    The <i>text</i> has the form
    <blockquote>
    [<tt>&#60;</tt><i>tok</i><tt>></tt>] <i>cmd</i>
    [<tt>&#60;</tt><i>tok</i><tt>></tt> <i>cmd</i>] ...
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Each <i>tok</i> is a combination of the letters <tt>s</tt>,
    <tt>c</tt>, and <tt>a</tt>.  The presence of the letters indicates
    that <b>Shift</b>, <b>Control</b> and <b>Alt</b> are pressed,
    respectively.  The <i>tok</i> is surrounded by angle brackets.

    <p>
    Examples:
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>&#60;s></tt><dd>
    The <b>Shift</b> key is pressed, <b>Control</b> and <b>Alt</b> are
    not pressed.
    <dt><tt>&#60;ca></tt><dd>
    The <b>Control</b> and <b>Alt</b> keys are pressed, the
    <b>Shift</b> key is not pressed.
    </dl>

    <p>
    These tokens are followed by a <i>cmd</i>, which is a command.  If
    the command starts with '<tt>!</tt>', the remainder is treated as
    a <a href="keybang">"bang" command</a>.  Otherwise, the text is
    the five-character (or fewer) command keyword associated with GUI
    command buttons.  If the <i>cmd</i> contains white space, it must
    be quoted.

    <p>
    The command keywords are displayed in the pop-up "tooltip" which
    appears when the mouse pointer is positioned over a command
    button, after a short delay.  This is the internal name for the
    command, which is generally a short mnemonic of five characters or
    fewer.  The keywords are also generally provided in the help
    system topic describing the command.  In the <b>User Menu</b>, for
    user scripts, the name which appears on the menu button is the
    appropriate name to use.

    <p>
    The first <i>tok</i> is generally absent, and the <i>cmd</i>
    applies to the function key with no modifiers pressed.

    Example:
    <blockquote>
    <tt>F1Key box &#60;s> "!exec /path/to/myscript.scr" &#60;c> !!Clear(0)
    &#60;sca> polyg</tt>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The terms are:
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>F1Key</tt><dd>
    We're setting the <b>F1</b> key in this example.
    <dt><tt>box</tt><dd>
    This indicates that when <b>F1</b> is pressed without pressing a
    modifier key, the "<tt>box</tt>" command from the side menu will be
    started.

    <dt><tt>&#60;s> "!exec /path/to/myscript.scr"</tt><dd>
    This specifies that when <b>Shift-F1</b> is pressed, the script in
    the <tt>myscript.scr</tt> file will be executed, using the <a
    href="!exec"><b>!exec</b></a> bang command.  Since the command
    contains a space character, it is quoted.

    <dt><tt>&#60;c> !!Clear(0)</tt><dd>
    This specifies that when <b>Control-F1</b> is pressed, the <a
    href="Clear"><tt>Clear()</tt></a> script function is called with
    argument 0.  This will clear the database.  Note that the
    single/double exclamation point syntax is the same as is accepted
    on the command line.

    <dt><tt>&#60;sca> polyg</tt><dd>
    When <b>Shift</b>, <b>Control</b>, and <b>Alt</b> are pressed
    along with <b>F1</b>, the "<tt>polyg</tt>" polygon creation
    command from the side menu is started.
    </dl>

    The menu containing the named button must be active (not grayed)
    for the function key to have effect.  The mappings are completely
    defined by the user - there are no defaults.  Pressing an unmapped
    function key has no effect on <i>Xic</i>.  Be aware that the
    window manager in use, and the GTK toolkit, may map functions
    keys, and this may have higher priority than the mapping assigned
    here.  The use of the <b>Alt</b> key is generally not a good idea,
    as it is commonly assigned for other purposes.  Sometimes, an
    assignment will simply be ignored for some reason.  For example,
    on one system <b>Control-F1</b> is never returned, but
    <b>Control</b> works fine with other function keys.

!!TITLE
Technology File Attributes:  Grid Registers
!!HTML
    The grid registers from the <a href="xic:grid"><b>Grid
    Setup</b></a> pop-up are saved in the technology file if they
    contain a non-default grid.

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>ElecGridReg</tt><i>N</i> <i>spec</i><br>
    <dt><tt>PhysGridReg</tt><i>N</i> <i>spec</i><dd>
    The <i>N</i> is an integer value in the range 1-7.  Each register
    index can store both a physical and electrical grid specification.
    The specifications define the contents of the grid registers,
    available in the <a href="xic:grid"><b>Grid Setup</b></a> panel
    and elsewhere.

    <p>
    The <i>spec</i> string has the form:
    <blockquote>
    <i>snapspace</i> <i>snapval</i> <i>linestyle</i> [<i>xsize</i>]
     [<tt>-a</tt> <i>axes</i>] [<tt>-d</tt> <i>dsp</i>]
     [<tt>-t</tt> <i>ontop</i>] [<tt>-m</tt> <i>cmult</i>]
    </blockquote>

    The first three tokens are mandatory, and must appear in the order
    shown.
 
    <dl>
    <dt><i>snapspace</i> (real number)<dd>
    The spacing between snap points, in microns.

    <dt><i>snapval</i> (integer, -10 through 10 excluding 0)<dd>
    If the value is positive, it sets the number of snap points per
    fine grid line.  For example, a value of 3 would indicate that a
    fine grid line is drawn at every third snap point.  If negative,
    this sets the number of fine grid lines per snap interval.  In
    this case, a value of three indicates that fine grid lines appear
    at snap points and at the 1/3 and 2/3 proportional distances
    within the snap interval.

    <dt><i>linestyle</i> (integer)<dd>
    This is the line style code.  The value is 0 for a dot grid,
    otherwise the bit pattern represents the line dashes, as for the
    <a href="GridStyle"><tt>GridStyle</tt></a> keyword.
    </dl>

    The remaining tokens are optional, and can follow the first three in any
    order.  

    <dl>
    <dt><i>xsize</i> (integer 0-6)<dd>
    If the <i>linestyle</i> code is 0 (for a dot grid), then a fourth
    number can appear.  This is an integer 0-6 which indicates the
    number of pixels in the four orthogonal directions to extend the
    dot into a cross.

    <dt><tt>-a</tt> <i>axes</i> (integer 0-2)<dd>
    This sets the axes presentation mode in physical mode.  If 0, axes
    aren't shown.  If 1, plain axes are shown, and if 2, axes are
    shown and the origin decorated.

    <dt><tt>-d</tt> <i>dsp</i> (boolean)<dd>
    This sets whether the grid is displayed or not.  The <i>dsp</i>
    token can be about any alphanumeric token that by convention
    indicates true or false.

    <dt><tt>-t</tt> <i>ontop</i> (boolean)<dd>
    This sets whether the grid is displayed after all geometry ("on
    top") or before geometry.  The <i>ontop</i> token can be about
    any alphanumeric token that by convention indicates true or false.

    <dt><tt>-m</tt> <i>cmult</i> (integer 1-50)<dd>
    This sets the number of fine grid lines per coarse grid line.
    </dl>
    For backward compatibility, "<tt>GridReg</tt>" is accepted as
    "<tt>PhysGridReg</tt>".

Technology File Attributes:  Font Assignments

    The keywords described below set the fonts used in various places
    in <i>Xic</i>.  These correspond to the fonts settable from the
    <b>Font Selection</b> pop-up from the <a href="xic:font"><b>Set
    Font</b></a> button in the <b>Attributes Menu</b>.

    <p>
    Since the font string format varies between the operating systems
    and graphical interfaces supported by <i>Xic</i>, provision is
    made for separate font specifications for each supported
    variation, thus making the technology file more portable between
    different versions of <i>Xic</i>.

    <p>
    There are six fonts that may be set, and four sets of
    corresponding keywords, specific to different systems.  The four
    sets correspond to a suffix character added to the font keyword. 

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Font1 - Font6</tt> <i>name_of_font</i><dd>
    These keywords will be read and (if possible) applied by any
    version of <i>Xic</i>.  Although there is an attempt at
    portability, the <i>name_of_font</i> should apply to the release
    of <i>Xic</i> in use.  A mismatch will not cause errors, but the
    font may not be as expected, or a default may be used.  These
    keywords are mostly for backwards compatibility, and are never
    written to a new technology file created with the <a
    href="xic:updat"><b>Save Tech</b></a> button in the <b>Attributes
    Menu</b>.  Rather, the system-specific keywords below will be
    written.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Font1P - Font6P</tt> <i>name_of_font</i><dd>
    These fonts apply to the releases that use the GTK-2 (Pango) font
    system.  At the 4.0 release level, all <i>XicTools</i> programs
    use this graphical toolkit, and will use these keywords.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Font1X - Font6X</tt> <i>name_of_font</i><dd>
    These keywords apply to non-current releases (FreeBSD7, Linux2, OS
    X) that use the GTK-1 X-windows font system.  The
    <i>name_of_font</i> is the X Logical Font Descriptor for a font
    available on the user's system, or an alias.  These font
    specifications are ignored in GTK-2 (all current) releases.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>Font1W - Font6W</tt> <i>name_of_font</i><dd>
    These keywords apply only to the non-current Microsoft Windows
    release, which used native Win32 for the graphical interface. 
    There is really no syntactical difference between these and
    Pango (<tt>P</tt>) specifications, and (current) GTK-2 releases
    will accept (but not write) these.
    </dl>

    <p>
    If a font is specified more than once in the technology file, such
    as with duplicate or equivalent keywords, the last specification
    read will take precedence.

    <p>
    When a new technology file is written, only the keywords for
    non-default fonts in use will actually be written in the file.

    <p>
    The index number of the keyword indicates the following fonts:
 
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>1</tt> (Fixed Pitch Text Window Font)<dd>
    This sets the font used in pop-up multi-line text windows other
    than the text editor/file browser, such as the <a

    <p>
    The platform-specific font keywords were added in release 3.1.6. 
    Older technology files will use only the <tt>Font1 - Font6</tt>

    "default definitions" have no effect on these lines.

    <p>
    The same variables can also be set with the <a
    href="techfile:set"><tt>!set</tt></a> lines.  If a variable is set
    multiple times by any means, the last one seen will have
    precedence.  The variables that participate in the protocol but
    are set with the <tt>!set</tt> line will not be remembered as
    having been set.  When a technology file is written, the
    remembered variables are given <tt>!set</tt> lines in the new
    file.  This is not necessary for variables that participate in the
    protocol.

    <p>
    Variables are logically divided into classes.  Boolean variables
    are switches that are either set (usually to an empty string) or
    not set.  Other variables we refer to as "string" variables.  They
    are set to an arbitrary text string, when set at all.

    <p>
    In the technology file, booleans take the form
    <blockquote>
    <i>VariableName</i> [<tt>y</tt>|<tt>n</tt>]
    </blockquote>
    which is the same syntax as for boolean keywords.  The
    "<tt>y</tt>|<tt>n</tt>" symbol implies that one of '<tt>y</tt>' or
    '<tt>n</tt>' can follow the keyword.  Actually, '<tt>0</tt>'
    (zero), or any word that begins with the letters or sequence (case
    insensitive) '<tt>n</tt>', '<tt>f</tt>', '<tt>of</tt>' is taken as
    a false value.  Anything else, including no following text, is
    taken as true ('<tt>y</tt>' is always redundant).  If the second
    token indicates affirmative, then the variable will be set.  If
    the second token is negative, no action is taken.

    <p>
    String variables take the form
    <blockquote>
    <i>VariableName</i> <i>arbitrary text</i>
    </blockquote>
    where the variable will be assigned the <i>arbitrary text</i>, with
    leading and training white space stripped.

    <p>
    The <b>!attrvars</b> command lists the variables that are boolean
    and string separately, so the user can check this list if unsure of
    the variable type.

    <p>
    The <i>VariableName</i> in this context is recognized as a known
    variable name without case sensitivity.  In every other context,
    variable names are case-sensitive.  Since this syntax applies
    only to internal variable names, there is no conflict as there
    are no such variables that differ only in case.

Hardcopy Driver Parameters
!!HTML
    By default, all hardcopy drivers available within the program are
    made available to the user through the <b>Format</b> menu in the
    <a href="hcopypanel"><b>Print Control Panel</b></a>.  Drivers can
    be disabled, so they don't appear in the <b>Format</b> menu, by
    adding the "<tt>off</tt>" keyword to the "<tt>HardCopyDevice</tt>"
    line, which begins the block of lines describing the driver
    defaults.  The driver blocks are found near the end of the
    technology file, and are written in their entirety when the <a
    href="xic:updat"><b>Save Tech</b></a> command is used to generate
    a technology file.  It is not an error for a driver block to be
    absent; internal defaults will be used.

    <p>
    The following keyword(s) may be used outside of the driver blocks
    to set the default print driver.

    <a name="DefaultDriver"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>DefaultDriver</tt> <i>driver_name</i>
    <dd>This keyword sets the default print driver to use in both
    electrical and physical modes.  When the <b>Print Control Panel</b>
    initially appears, the <b>Format</b> menu will have this driver
    selected.  The <i>driver_name</i> is one of the driver names as
    listed in the <a href="HardCopyDevice"><tt>HardCopyDevice</tt></a>
    keyword description.  The keyword <tt>AltDriver</tt> is recognized
    as a synonym for this keyword.
    </dl>

    <a name="ElecDefaultDriver"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>ElecDefaultDriver</tt> <i>driver_name</i>
    <dd>Similar to <tt>DefaultDriver</tt>, but sets the default to use
    in electrical mode only.  The keyword <tt>AltElecDriver</tt> is a
    synonym.
    </dl>

    <a name="PhysDefaultDriver"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>PhysDefaultDriver</tt> <i>driver_name</i>
    <dd>Similar to <tt>DefaultDriver</tt>, but sets the default to use
    in physical mode only.  The keyword <tt>AltPhysDriver</tt> is a
    synonym.
    </dl>

    <p>
    A driver block begins with a <tt>HardCopyDevice</tt> line naming
    the driver, and ends with the next <tt>HardCopyDevice</tt> line or
    end of file.  In addition to the <tt>HardCopy...</tt> keywords
    that specify driver defaults, any of the keywords described in the
    <a href="techfile:attr#pattr"><b>Presentation Attributes</b></a>
    and <a href="techfile:attr#color"><b>Attribute Colors</b></a>
    categories of the <a href="techfile:attr"><b>Technology File
    Attributes</b></a> section can be used.  The attribute or color
    will then apply while in print mode and the driver is selected,
    both on-screen and in the driver output.  The keyword formats are
    exactly as described in these subsections.  If not given in a
    driver block, the driver will use the attribute or color values
    set in the main part of the technology file, or the program
    defaults if no value is specified.

    <p>
    Layer colors, fill, and visibility can be set on a per-layer
    basis for the driver, by including a "mini-layer block".  This is
    a truncated version of the layer blocks described in <a
    href="techfile:layers"><b>Technology File Layer Blocks</b></a>. 
    The only keywords which are accepted in a mini-layer block are
    <tt>RGB</tt> (to set the color), <tt>Filled</tt> (to set the fill
    pattern or outline style, and <tt>Invisible</tt> (to set
    visibility).  However, there are two additional special keywords
    that may be included in specific drivers:

    <a name="HPGLfilled"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>HPGLfilled</tt> <i>filltype</i> [ <i>option1 option2</i> ]
    <dd>This keyword is recognized and used only by the HP-GL
    hard-copy driver ("hpgl_line_sraw_color"), and is used to specify
    a fill pattern for the layer (electrical or physical).  The
    parameters are those appropriate for the <tt>FT</tt> HPGL
    directive, as documented in <i>The HP-GL2 and HP RTL Reference
    Guide:  A Handbook for Program Developers</i> from
    Hewlett-Packard, (ISBN 0-201-63325-6) pages 127-129.  This is
    summarized below:

    <p>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr>
     <th>filltype</th>
     <th>description</th>
     <th>option1</th>
     <th>option2</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>1</td>
     <td>solid, bidirectional</td>
     <td>ignored</td>
     <td>ignored</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>2</td>
     <td>solid, unidirectional</td>
     <td>ignored</td>
     <td>ignored</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>3</td>
     <td>hatched, parallel lines</td>
     <td>line spacing</td>
     <td>line angle</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>4</td>
     <td>crosshatched</td>
     <td>line spacing</td>
     <td>line angle</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>10</td>
     <td>shadings</td>
     <td>shading level</td>
     <td>ignored</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
     <td>11</td>
     <td>not supported</td>
     <td>ignored</td>
     <td>ignored</td>
    </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
    There are 1016 dots per inch and angles are in degrees.  Shading
    level is 0-100.  If the <tt>HPGLfilled</tt> keyword is supplied
    for a layer and the <i>filltype</i> and options (if given) are
    valid, that fill will be used with the layer in HPGL output. 
    There is presently no way to assign the layer color.

    <p>
    This parameter must be added to the technology file with a text
    editor.  The default is no fill.  Note that the fill patterns
    set on the screen in hard copy mode are not used by the HP-GL
    driver.
    </dl>

    <a name="XfigFilled"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>XfigFilled</tt> <i>filltype</i>
    <dd>This keyword is recognized and used only by the <tt>xfig</tt>
    hard copy driver ("xfig_line_draw_color"), and allows setting the
    fill patterns for the layer (electrical or physical).  The
    <i>filltype</i> is an integer 1-56, which selects one of
    <tt>xfig</tt>'s internal fill patterns.

    <p>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><td>0</td><td>No fill</td></tr>
    <tr><td>...</td><td>shades</td></tr>
    <tr><td>20</td><td>Full saturation of the color</td></tr>
    <tr><td>...</td><td>tints</td></tr>
    <tr><td>40</td><td>White</td></tr>
    <tr><td>41</td><td>30 degree left diagonal pattern</td></tr>
    <tr><td>42</td><td>30 degree right diagonal pattern</td></tr>
    <tr><td>43</td><td>30 degree crosshatch</td></tr>
    <tr><td>44</td><td>45 degree left diagonal pattern</td></tr>
    <tr><td>45</td><td>45 degree right diagonal pattern</td></tr>
    <tr><td>46</td><td>45 degree crosshatch</td></tr>
    <tr><td>47</td><td>Bricks</td></tr>
    <tr><td>48</td><td>Circles</td></tr>
    <tr><td>49</td><td>Horizontal lines</td></tr>
    <tr><td>50</td><td>Vertical lines</td></tr>
    <tr><td>51</td><td>Crosshatch</td></tr>
    <tr><td>52</td><td>Fish scales</td></tr>
    <tr><td>53</td><td>Small fish scales</td></tr>
    <tr><td>54</td><td>Octagons</td></tr>
    <tr><td>55</td><td>Horizontal "tire treads"</td></tr>
    <tr><td>56</td><td>Vertical "tire treads"</td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>
    Values 1 to 19 are "shades" of the color, from darker to lighter,
    a shade is defined as the color mixed with black.  Values from 21
    to 39 are "tints" of the color from the color to white, a tint is
    defined as the color mixed with white.  The <tt>XfigFilled</tt>
    parameter must be added to the technology file with a text editor. 
    The default is no fill.  Note that the fill patterns set on the
    screen in hard copy mode are not used by the <tt>xfig</tt> driver.
    </dl>

    <p>
    As for regular layer blocks, a mini-layer block starts with a
    <tt>PhysLayer</tt> or <tt>ElecLayer</tt> keyword, or one of the
    aliases.  The layer name given must be the name of a layer
    supplied in one of the regular layer blocks.  A mini-layer block
    terminates when a new mini-layer block starts, or at the end of
    the driver block.  The block order, and order with respect to
    other keywords, is arbitrary.

    <p>
    The other keywords of the driver block are described below.

    <a name="HardCopyDevice"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>HardCopyDevice</tt> <i>device_name</i> [off]
    <dd>This line begins the driver block, and the keywords that
    follow apply to the <i>device_name</i> driver.  The names are
    internally recognized strings:
    <blockquote><tt>
        hp_laser_pcl<br>
        hpgl_line_draw_color<br>
        postscript_bitmap<br>
        postscript_bitmap_encoded<br>
        postscript_bitmap_color<br>
        postscript_bitmap_color_encoded<br>
        postscript_line_draw<br>
        postscript_line_draw_color<br>
        windows_native<br>
        xfig_line_draw_color<br>
        image<br>
    </tt></blockquote>
    If the "<tt>off</tt>" keyword is given ("<tt>disable</tt>" and
    "<tt>n</tt>" are synonyms), the driver is disabled, and will not
    appear in the <b>Format</b> menu of the <b>Print Control
    Panel</b>.
    </dl>

    <a name="HardCopyLegend"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>HardCopyLegend</tt> <i>n</i>
    <dd>
    This keyword sets the default status of the <b>Legend</b> button
    in the <b>Print Control Panel</b> when the driver is active. 
    Values can be 0, 1, or 2:
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><td>0</td><td><b>Legend</b> button is off</td></tr>
    <tr><td>1</td><td><b>Legend</b> button is on</td></tr>
    <tr><td>2</td><td><b>Legend</b> button is grayed and inactive</td></tr>
    </table>
    </dl>

    <a name="HardCopyOrient"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>HardCopyOrient</tt> <i>n</i>
    <dd>
    This keyword sets the default status of the <b>Portrait</b>,
    <b>Landscape</b>, and <b>Best Fit</b> buttons in the <b>Print
    Control Panel</b> while the driver is active.  Values are 0-3:
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><td>bit 0 set</td><td><b>Landscape</b> on, <b>Portrait</b> off
     </td></tr>
    <tr><td>bit 0 unset</td><td><b>Landscape</b> off, <b>Portrait</b> on
     </td></tr>
    <tr><td>bit 1 set</td><td><b>Best Fit</b> button on</td></tr>
    <tr><td>bit 1 unset</td><td><b>Best Fit</b> button off</td></tr>
    </table>
    </dl>

    <a name="HardCopyCommand"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>HardCopyCommand</tt> <i>command string</i>
    <dd>Specifies the command to use to queue the plot.  This will be
    shown in the command text box of the <b>Print Control Panel</b>. 
    The characters "%s" will be replaced with the name of the
    temporary file, all other characters are passed verbatim.  If "%s"
    does not appear in the string, the file name will be appended to
    the string, separated by a space character.  This keyword is
    ignored under Microsoft Windows.
    </dl>

    <a name="HardCopyResol"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>HardCopyResol</tt> <i>list_of_integers</i>
    <dd>This sets the resolutions supported by the driver, in dots per
      inch.
    </dl>

    <a name="HardCopyDefResol"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>HardCopyDefResol</tt> <i>integer</i>
    <dd>This has meaning only to drivers that have selectable
    resolutions.  The value following this keyword is a zero-based
    index into the list of resolutions as given with the
    <tt>HardCopyResol</tt> keyword, and indicates the default
    resolution which will be selected in the <b>Print Control
    Panel</b> for the driver.

    <p>
    Example:
    <blockquote><tt>
    HardCopyDevice postscript_line_draw<br>
    HardCopyResol 72 75 100 150 200 300 400<br>
    HardCopyDefResol 2<br>
    </tt></blockquote>

    This will select 100 as the resolution for the
    <tt>postscript_line_draw</tt> driver when the <b>Print Control
    Panel</b> first appears.  The resolution can be changed with the
    menu.
    </dl>

    <a name="HardCopyDefB"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>HardCopyDefHeight</tt> <i>float_number</i>
    <dt><tt>HardCopyDefWidth</tt> <i>float_number</i>
    <dt><tt>HardCopyDefXoff</tt> <i>float_number</i>
    <dt><tt>HardCopyDefYoff</tt> <i>float_number</i>
    <dd>These set the default image size and location, and are in
    inches, unless followed by the letter 'c' which denotes
    centimeters.  The <tt>Yoff</tt> number may be interpreted as a top
    or bottom margin, depending upon the driver.  The dimensions are
    in all cases relative to the portrait orientation of the page.  If
    the width or height is set to zero (but not both) the driver will
    assume auto-width or auto-hight mode, where the width or height is
    set to the minimum necessary to render the object.
    </dl>

    <a name="HardCopyMinB"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><tt>HardCopyMinHeight</tt> <i>float_number</i>

    One can use the resource-setting capability of the X-Windows
    system to set attribute colors.  This applies when running under
    the X-Windows system, which is presently true for all releases
    except those for Microsoft Windows.  However, this is archaic and
    not really recommended.

    <p>
    One can create an X resource file for <i>Xic</i>.  This is a file
    that should be created in the user's home directory, with a name
    that is the executable program name with the first letter
    capitalized, i.e., <tt>Xic</tt>.  The file contains lines in the
    following form:

    <blockquote><tt>
    xic.HighlightingColor: green<br>
    xic.MarkerColor: blue
    </tt></blockquote>

    or generally
    <blockquote>
    <tt>xic.</tt><i>resourcename</i>: <i>colorspec</i>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    The <i>resourcename</i> is a keyword from the list of <a
    href="techfile:attr#color">attribute colors</a>.  Note that the
    keyword must be used, not an alias.  The aliases are recognized in
    the technology file and <a href="!setcolor"><b>!setcolor</b></a>
    command.  The <i>colorspec</i> string is the name of a color or an
    RGB triple:

    <ul>
    <li>The name of a color.  The recognized names can be listed from
    the <a href"xic:color"><b>Set Color</b></a> pop-up in the
    <b>Attributes</b> menu with the <b>Colors</b> button.

    <li>Three space-separated numbers, each 0-255, representing the
    red, green, and blue intensity.  E.g., "196 240 235".

    <li>Other forms recognized by the <tt>XParseColor</tt> C library
    function, including "<tt>#RRRRGGGGBBBB</tt>" and
    "<tt>rgb:RRRR/GGGG/BBBB</tt>".  Here, <tt>R</tt>, <tt>G</tt>, and

Obsolete Keywords, Updating Legacy Techfiles
!!HTML
    Prior ro release 3.2.11, there were "<tt>Alt</tt>" versions of
    many technology file keywords, which were active during print mode
    only (for any driver).  In release 3.2.11, the system was changed
    so that attributes could be set on a per-driver basis, by
    including the regular keyword within the driver block.  The
    "<tt>Alt</tt>" keywords are presently obsolete.

    <p>
    The presence of these keywords in legacy technology files will do
    no harm, but will generate warning messages when the technology
    file is read.  There is no common print-mode attribute set, so the
    attributes in force in print mode will not be the same as in
    earlier releases.

    <p>
    A legacy technology file can be fairly easily updated by hand,
    using a text editor.  Search the file for "<tt>Alt</tt>".  The
    obsolete keywords are listed in the tables below.  Following each
    table are instructions for dealing with those keywords.

    These are the obsolete color and attribute keywords.  Move the line
    into the print driver blocks that you use, and wish to have that
    attribute or color in force.  Delete the "<tt>Alt</tt>" part of
    the keyword.  The driver blocks are found near the end of the
    file.  The new lines can be placed at the end of the block.

    <p>
    Exceptions are the GridSpacing keywords, these should be deleted
    as they are not recognized in print blocks.

    <p>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><th>Obsolete Layer Block Keywords</th></tr)
    <tr><th>Keyword</th></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>AltRGB</tt></td></tr)
    <tr><td><tt>AltFilled</tt></td></tr)
    <tr><td><tt>AltInvisible</tt></td></tr)
    <tr><td><tt>HPGLfilled</tt></td></tr)
    <tr><td><tt>XfigFilled</tt></td></tr)
    </table>

    <p>
    These are keywords that may be found in the layer blocks.  If the
    "<tt>Alt</tt>" keyword was found in a layer block, it must be
    included in a "mini-layer block" in the driver block for each
    driver where the attribute should be in force.  This means that it
    must follow a layer definition line in the driver block, that may
    have to be added as well.  These are lines like "<tt>LayerName
    FOO</tt>" or "<tt>ElecLayer SCED</tt>".

    <p>
    For example, suppose that the "<tt>LayerName FOO</tt>" block
    contains an <tt>AltRGB</tt> line and an <tt>AltFilled</tt> line. 
    Copy the "<tt>LayerName FOO</tt>" line to the desired layer
    blocks.  Follow these with the <tt>AltRGB</tt> and
    <tt>AltFilled</tt> lines, with the "<tt>Alt</tt>" removed (so just
    "<tt>RGB</tt>" and "<tt>Filled</tt>"), and remove these lines from
    the original layer block.

    <p>
    The <tt>HPGLfilled</tt> and <tt>XfigFilled</tt> keywords, if found
    in the main layer blocks, should be moved into a mini-layer block
    in the HPGL and Xfig drivers (respectively) only.

    <p>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><th>Obsolete Driver Block Keywords</th></tr)
    <tr><th>Keyword</th></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>NoAlt</tt></td></tr)
    </table>

    <p>
    The <tt>NoAlt</tt> keyword, if found in driver blocks, should be
    deleted.

    <p>
    <table border=1 cellpadding=2 bgcolor="#ffffee">
    <tr><th colspan=2>Deprecated Keywords</th></tr)
    <tr><th>Old Keyword</th> <th>New Keyword</th></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>LayerName</tt></td> <td><tt>PhysLayer</tt></td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>AltDriver</tt></td> <td><tt>DefaultDriver</tt></td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>AltElecDriver</tt></td> <td><tt>ElecDefaultDriver</tt></td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>ElecAltDriver</tt></td> <td><tt>ElecDefaultDriver</tt></td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>AltPhysDriver</tt></td> <td><tt>PhysDefaultDriver</tt></td></tr>
    <tr><td><tt>PhysAltDriver</tt></td> <td><tt>PhysDefaultDriver</tt></td></tr>
    </table>

    <p>
    Finally, there are a few keywords whose name has changed.  The old
    name is still recognized, so updating is optional, but it is
    recommended that these be changed to the new name.
