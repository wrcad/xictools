    <p>
    The interface uses an external program to extract capacitance
    values between conducting features in the layout.  The interface
    supports the following capacitance extraction programs:
    <ol>
    <li>The <i>FasterCap</i> program from <a
    href="http://fastfieldsolvers.com"><tt>FastFieldSolvers.com</tt></a>. 
    This commercial program is recommended for users with capacitance
    extraction as an important workflow element.  The auto-refinement
    capability provides the best accuracy with the least amount of
    setup.

    <p>
    <li>The <i>FastCap</i> program from Whiteley Research.
    The interface also provides a crude, linear panel refinement
    capability which can be used with this free version of
    <i>FastCap</i>, which is available from the Whiteley Research free
    software archive.  We will refer to the Whiteley Research program
    as <i>FastCap-WR</i> to distinguish it from the MIT original.
    </ol>

    <p>
    The interface generates a unified list file, which is compatible
    with the programs listed above.  It is <b>not</b> directly
    compatible with the original MIT <i>FastCap</i> program, or its
    derivatives, that require multiple input files.  There are
    accessory programs <a href="lstpack"><tt>lstpack</tt></a> and
    <tt>lstunpack</tt> available which convert between the formats, so
    the MIT <i>FastCap</i> can be used in a two-step flow involving
    unpacking.

    <p>
    This is the second generation capacitance extraction interface. 
    The original capacitance extraction interface, found in releases
    4.0.8 and earlier, was quite a bit more complicated.  The present
    interface affords at least the following simplifications:

    <ul>
    <li>The interface presently takes material from the current cell
    as input, there is no need to select and save things into the
    interface.
    <p>
    <li>There is no "dataset name", the file names use the current
    cell name as a base name.
    <p>
    <li>The output file is always a unified list file, there is no
    "old format" support except via the separate <tt>lstpack</tt> and
    <tt>lstunpack</tt> utilities.
    <p>
    <li>There is no graphical "partition editor" as <i>FasterCap</i>
    does not need external refinement.
    </ul>

    The new interface, however, is much more flexible and powerful
    than the original interface.
    <ul>
    <li>There is no longer a fixed assumption that layers are planar,
    or that layer ordering must begin with a conductor and alternate
    with insulators.  Layers can appear in any order, and any layer
    can be planarizing, or not.  If a layer is planarizing, it will
    have variable thickness such that the top surface is in one plane.

    <p>
    <li>There is a new <a href="xic:ldb3d">layer-sequencing engine</a>
    that is also used by the <a href="xic:csect"><b>Cross
    Section</b></a> display command (in the <b>View Menu</b>), as well
    as for <a href="fhinterf">inductance/resistance extraction</a>. 
    Thus, the cross section display will always faithfully represent
    the assumptions used in the interface.  Layer ordering is
    basically that shown in the <a href="layertab">layer table</a>,
    though <tt>Via</tt> layers are allowed to be out of sequence
    (likely for drawing visibility reasons).  The "real" position of a
    <tt>Via</tt> layer can be obtained from the layers it references.

    <p>
    <li>Geometry is taken from the current cell, to all levels of the
    hierarchy.  There is provision for use of a special masking layer. 
    If this layer is found in the layout, geometry will be clipped to
    the patterning on this layer.

    <p>
    <li>The substrate is now more accurately included in the
    calculation, taking into account the actual thickness and lateral
    extent.
    </ul>

    <a name="geom"></a>
    <h2>Geometry Construction</h2>

    By default, a layer named "<tt>FCAP</tt>" will serve as the
    masking layer.  If, however, the <a
    href="FcLayerName"><b>FcLayerName</b></a> variable is set to a
    layer name, that layer will provide the masking function.  We will
    refer to this layer as the "mask layer".

    <p>
    If no objects are found on the mask layer, all geometry in the
    current cell will be treated in the interface.  Be advised that
    the capacitance extraction will very rapidly become untenable if
    too much geometry is included.  The interface itself is not
    designed to handle large object collections, though it will remain
    snappy while generating files that may take weeks to run.  More
    than 100 objects is probably pushing things.  The effective area
    of interest (AOI) is the bounding box of the current cell.

    <p>
    If objects are found on the mask layer, then the mask layer
    pattern is <b>and</b>ed with the other layers, and the resulting
    geometry is processed by the interface.  The bounding box of the
    mask layer patterning becomes the effective AOI, which can be
    much smaller than the cell bounding box.  In any case, the AOI
    bounds all geometry in the problem.

    <p>
    The geometry is as shown in the drawing window, though geometry is
    saved in an internal representation that removes any overlap of
    objects in the original layout.  Outside of the AOI, and above all
    geometry and below the substrate, vacuum (relative permittivity of
    1.0) is assumed.

    <p>
    The substrate is included in the calculation as follows.  A
    variable named <a
    href="SubstrateThickness"><b>SubstrateThickness</b></a> can be set
    to specify the assumed substrate thickness in microns.  If not
    set, a thickness of 75 microns is assumed.  Typically, the
    substrate thickness would be set in the technology file with the
    <tt>SubstrateThickness</tt> keyword, which sets the variable.  It
    can be set interactively from the <b>Params</b> page of the <a
    href="fcpanel"><b>Cap Extraction</b></a> panel.

    <p>
    <b>If the substrate has nonzero thickness</b>:

    <blockquote>
    The boundary of the substrate is taken as the AOI, bloated by the
    value given by the <a href="FcPlaneBloat"><b>FcPlaneBloat</b></a>
    variable.  This is generally desirable to move the substrate edge
    effectively away from structures of interest.  If not set, a value
    of 0.0 micron is assumed.

    <p>
    Interface panels will be created on the sides and bottom of the
    substrate when the input list file is generated.  If a positive
    <tt>FcPlaneBloat</tt> is given, dielectric interface panels will
    also cover the top of the substrate outside of the AOI.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    <b>If the substrate has zero thickness</b>:

    <blockquote>
    This is obtained by setting the <b>SubstrateThickness</b> variable
    to 0.  We attempt to treat the substrate as filling the infinite
    half space, though is is not clear how to convey this to
    <i>FasterCap</i>.  Outside of the AOI, the substrate/vacuum
    interface extends to infinity.  We approximate this with finite
    panels extending a distance given by <b>FcPlaneBloat</b> out of
    the AOI.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    NOTE:  the original interface made no attempt to deal with the
    substrate.  This is reasonable, as the different substrate
    treatments should have little effect on results in most cases.

    <p>
    Note also that the <tt>FcPlaneBloat</tt> parameter extends the
    substrate only, and not the geometry.  This is different from the
    original interface, which would also extend the dark-field layers.
    To effectively bloat the geometry as well as the substrate, one can
    use the <tt>FCAP</tt> layer in most cases to enlarge the AOI.

    <a href="tech"></a>
    <h2>Technology File Setup</h2>

    Setup parallels setup of the <a href="xic:ldb3d">three-dimensional
    layer sequence database</a>, which in turn follows setup of the <a
    href="ext:setup">extraction system</a>.  These sections should be
    consulted for detailed setup information, here we provide some
    supplemental information.

    <p>
    To the interface, there are two different materials:
    <dl>
    <dt>conductors<dd>
    Conductors will have one of the following:
    <ol>
    <li>Any of the <a href="Conductor"><tt>Conductor</tt></a>,
    <a href="Routing"><tt>Routing</tt></a>, <a
    href="GroundPlane"><tt>GroundPlane</tt></a>, <a
    href="GroundPlaneClear"><tt>GroundPlaneClear</tt></a>, or <a
    href="Contact"><tt>Contact</tt></a> technology file keywords (or
    their aliases) applied.  All of these implicitly give the
    <tt>Conductor</tt> keyword.

    <p>
    <li>Any of the <a href="Rsh"><tt>Rsh</tt></a>, <a
    href="Rho"><tt>Rho</tt></a>, <a href="Sigma"><tt>Sigma</tt></a>,
    or <a href="Lambda"><tt>Lambda</tt></a> keywords applied with a
    positive value.
    </ol>
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt>insulators<dd>
    Insulators will have one of the
    <a href="Dielectric"><tt>Dielectric</tt></a>
    or <a href="Via"><tt>Via</tt></a> keywords applied, and also the
    <a href="EpsRel"><tt>EpsRel</tt></a> keyword applied with a value
    of 1.0 or larger.
    </dl>

    In addition, layers that are to be used in the interface as conductors
    or insulators must have all of the following:
    <ul>
    <li>A <a href="Thickness"><tt>Thickness</tt></a> keyword applied with a
    value greater than zero.
    <li>Must be visible in the layer table.
    <li>Must not have the <a href="Symbolic"><tt>Symbolic</tt></a>
    keyword applied.
    </ul>

    The <tt>Dielectric</tt> technology file keyword was added to
    support this interface.  This is intended to model an explicit
    capacitor dielectric, and differs from <tt>Via</tt> layers in the
    following ways.
    <ul>
    <li>Unlike <tt>Via</tt>, it is not assumed to be dark field (but
    <a href="DarkField"><tt>DarkField</tt></a> can be applied to the
    layer explicitly).
    <li>Only one <tt>Dielectric</tt> keyword can appear per layer
    (multiple <tt>Via</tt> keywords are allowed).
    <li>Stacking order is as shown in the layer table (<tt>Via</tt>
    layers are allowed to appear out of order).
    <li><tt>Dielectric</tt> layers are not planarizing by default,
    <tt>Via</tt> layers are.
    </ul>

    <p>
    The present interface can take layers in any order.  This is in
    contrast with the original interface, that required layers to
    alternate conductor/insulator starting with a conductor, and
    ordering was obtained entirely from <tt>Via</tt> references and
    not the layer table order.

    <p>
    After all possible layers from the layer table are sequenced,
    layers that are not used in the extracted geometry are discarded. 
    Note that dark-field layers are inverted, as we are interested in
    representing the physical material.  Thus, for example no
    structure in a <tt>Via</tt> layer (i.e., no vias) in the layout
    implies the presence of a continuous film of insulating material,
    so the layer is actually present.

    <p>
    The same layer sequencer is used in the <a
    href="xic:csect"><b>Cross Section</b></a> command in the <b>View
    Menu</b>.  The cross section display and the interface will always
    agree on the ordering and planarization of the layers.  It is
    therefor a useful visualization tool when setting up the layers in
    the technology file.

    <p>
    The <b>Cross Section</b> command is also useful for finding
    errors.  One possible error occurs when not planarizing, and a
    thin metal layer runs over the edge of a thicker dielectric layer. 
    This will disconnect the metal between the two sides of the step,
    which will cause a failure in the extraction.  Presently, the
    interface assumes that the number of conductor groups remains the
    same before and after 3D processing.  The disconnection can be
    easily seen in the <b>Cross Section</b> view.

    <p>
    In addition to the layers that describe material geometry, the
    interface can make use of a <a href="fcinterf#geom">masking
    layer<a>.  This allows only certain specified parts of the current
    cell to be evaluated.  When present, geometry is clipped to
    objects on this layer before being processed in the interface.

    <p>
    By default, a layer named <tt>FCAP</tt> with purpose
    <tt>drawing</tt> is assumed for the masking layer.  Such a layer
    should be defined in the technology file.  It should be given a
    GDSII mapping to allow saving of work containing the layer to
    GDSII or OASIS files.  As an alternative, the <a
    href="FcLayerName"><b>FcLayerName</b></a> variable can be set to
    the name of another layer, which will instead provide the masking
    function.

    <a href="output"></a>
    <h2>Output File</h2>

    The output file is a unified <i>FasterCap</i> list file.  At the
    top of the file is a comment containing the layer sequence.  For
    example:

    <p>
    <pre>
    * Layers           Plane        Thickness    EpsRel
    * Substrate                     75.000       11.900
    * Insulator CO     0.000        0.190        4.200
    * Insulator VIA1   0.190        0.095        2.900
    * Insulator VIA2   0.285        0.095        2.900
    * Insulator VIA3   0.380        0.095        2.900
    * Conductor M4     0.475        0.220
    * Insulator VIA4   0.695        0.095        2.900

    * Insulator VIA5   1.010        0.095        2.900
    * Conductor M6     1.105        0.220
    * Insulator VIA6   1.325        0.095        2.900
    * Insulator VIA7   1.420        0.610        4.200
    * Insulator VIA8   2.030        0.610        4.200
    </pre>

    <p>
    The <tt>Plane</tt> is the base elevation of the mask objects of a
    planarizing layer, that is, the top surface of the layer minus the
    layer thickness value.  This field will be empty for
    non-planarizing layers.

The interface uses an external program to extract capacitance values
between conducting features in the layout.  The interface supports the
following capacitance extraction programs:

\begin{enumerate}
\item{The {\it FasterCap} program from {\vt FastFieldSolvers.com}. 
This commercial program is recommended for users with capacitance
extraction as an important workflow element.  The auto-refinement
capability provides the best accuracy with the least amount of setup.}

\item{The {\it FastCap} program from Whiteley Research.  The interface

used with this free version of {\it FastCap\/}, which is available
from the Whiteley Research free software archive.  We will refer to
the Whiteley Research program as {\it FastCap-WR} to distinguish it
from the MIT original.}
\end{enumerate}

The interface generates a unified list file, which is compatible with
the programs listed above.  It is {\bf not} directly compatible with
the original MIT {\it FastCap} program, or its derivatives, that
require multiple input files.  There are accessory programs {\vt
lstpack} and {\vt lstunpack} available which convert between the
formats, so the MIT {\it FastCap} can be used in a two-step flow
involving unpacking.

This is the second generation capacitance extraction interface.  The
original capacitance extraction interface, found in releases 4.0.8 and
earlier, was quite a bit more complicated.  The present interface
affords at least the following simplifications:

\begin{itemize}
\item{The interface presently takes material from the current cell
as input, there is no need to select and save things into the
interface.}

\item{There is no ``dataset name'', the file names use the current
cell name as a base name.}

\item{The output file is always a unified list file, there is no ``old

\item{There is no graphical ``partition editor'' as {\it FasterCap}
does not need external refinement.}

\end{itemize}

%-----------------------------------
\subsubsection{Geometry Construction}
\label{subsaoi}

By default, a layer named ``{\vt FCAP}'' will serve as the masking
layer.  If, however, the {\et FcLayerName} variable is set to a
layer name, that layer will provide the masking function.  We will
refer to this layer as the ``mask layer''.

If no objects are found on the mask layer, all geometry in the current
cell will be treated in the interface.  Be advised that the
capacitance extraction will very rapidly become untenable if too much
geometry is included.  The interface itself is not designed to handle
large object collections, though it will remain snappy while
generating files that may take weeks to run.  More than 100 objects is
probably pushing things.  The effective area of interest (AOI) is the
bounding box of the current cell.

If objects are found on the mask layer, then the mask layer pattern is
{\bf and}ed with the other layers, and the resulting geometry is
processed by the interface.  The bounding box of the mask layer
patterning becomes the effective AOI, which can be much smaller than
the cell bounding box.  In any case, the AOI bounds all geometry in
the problem.

The geometry is as shown in the drawing window, though geometry is
saved in an internal representation that removes any overlap of
objects in the original layout.  Outside of the AOI, and above all
geometry and below the substrate, vacuum (relative permittivity of
1.0) is assumed.

The substrate is included in the calculation as follows.  A variable
named {\et SubstrateThickness} can be set to specify the assumed
substrate thickness in microns.  If not set, a thickness of 75 microns
is assumed.  Typically, the substrate thickness would be set in the
technology file with the {\vt SubstrateThickness} keyword, which sets
the variable.  It can be set interactively from the {\cb Params} page
of the {\cb Cap Extraction} panel (see \ref{fcpanel}).

{\bf If the substrate has nonzero thickness}:

\begin{quote}
The boundary of the substrate is taken as the AOI, bloated by the
value given by the {\et FcPlaneBloat} variable.  This is generally
desirable to move the substrate edge effectively away from structures
of interest.  If not set, a value of 0.0 micron is assumed.

Interface panels will be created on the sides and bottom of the
substrate when the input list file is generated.  If a positive {\et
FcPlaneBloat} is given, dielectric interface panels will also cover
the top of the substrate outside of the AOI.
\end{quote}

{\bf If the substrate has zero thickness}:

\begin{quote}
This is obtained by setting the {\et SubstrateThickness} variable to
0.  We attempt to treat the substrate as filling the infinite half
space, though is is not clear how to convey this to {\it FasterCap\/}. 
Outside of the AOI, the substrate/vacuum interface extends to
infinity.  We approximate this with finite panels extending a distance
given by {\et FcPlaneBloat} out of the AOI.
\end{quote}

NOTE:  the original interface made no attempt to deal with the
substrate.  This is reasonable, as the different substrate treatments
should have little effect on results in most cases.

Note also that the {\et FcPlaneBloat} parameter extends the substrate
only, and not the geometry.  This is different from the original
interface, which would also extend the dark-field layers.  To
effectively bloat the geometry as well as the substrate, one can use
the {\vt FCAP} layer in most cases to enlarge the AOI.

%-----------------------------------
\subsubsection{Technology File Setup}

Setup parallels setup of the three-dimensional layer sequence database
(see \ref{ldb3d}), which in turn follows setup of the extraction
system (see \ref{extsetup}).  These sections should be consulted for
detailed setup information, here we provide some supplemental
information.

To the interface, there are two different materials:
\begin{description}
\item{conductors}\\
Conductors will have one of the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Any of the {\vt Conductor}, {\vt Routing}, {\vt GroundPlane},
{\vt GroundPlaneClear}, or {\vt Contact} technology file keywords (or
their aliases) applied.  All of these implicitly give the {\et
Conductor} keyword.}

\item{Any of the {\et Rsh}, {\et Rho}, {\et Sigma}, or {\et Lambda}
keywords applied with a positive value.}
\end{enumerate}

\item{insulators}\\
Insulators will have one of the {\et Dielectric} or {\et Via} keywords
applied, and also the {\et EpsRel} keyword applied with a value of 1.0
or larger.
\end{description}

In addition, layers that are to be used in the interface as conductors
or insulators must have all of the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item{A {\et Thickness} keyword applied with a value greater than
zero.}

\item{Must be visible in the layer table.}

\item{Must not have the {\et Symbolic} keyword applied.}
\end{itemize}

The {\et Dielectric} technology file keyword was added to support this
interface.  This is intended to model an explicit capacitor
dielectric, and differs from {\et Via} layers in the following ways.

\begin{itemize}
\item{Unlike {\et Via}, it is not assumed to be dark field (but {\et
DarkField} can be applied to the layer explicitly).}

\item{Only one {\et Dielectric} keyword can appear per layer (multiple
{\et Via} keywords are allowed).}

\item{Stacking order is as shown in the layer table ({\et Via} layers
are allowed to appear out of order).}

\item{{\et Dielectric} layers are not planarizing by default, {\et
Via} layers are.}
\end{itemize}

The present interface can take layers in any order.  This is in
contrast with the original interface, that required layers to
alternate conductor/insulator starting with a conductor, and ordering
was obtained entirely from {\et Via} references and not the layer
table order.

After all possible layers from the layer table are sequenced, layers
that are not used in the extracted geometry are discarded.  Note that
dark-field layers are inverted, as we are interested in representing
the physical material.  Thus, for example no structure in a {\et Via}
layer (i.e., no vias) in the layout implies the presence of a
continuous film of insulating material, so the layer is actually
present.

The same layer sequencer is used in the {\cb Cross Section} command in
the {\cb View Menu}.  The cross section display and the interface will
always agree on the ordering and planarization of the layers.  It is
therefor a useful visualization tool when setting up the layers in the
technology file.

The {\cb Cross Section} command is also useful for finding errors. 
One possible error occurs when not planarizing, and a thin metal layer
runs over the edge of a thicker dielectric layer.  This will
disconnect the metal between the two sides of the step, which will
cause a failure in the extraction.  Presently, the interface assumes
that the number of conductor groups remains the same before and after
3D processing.  The disconnection can be easily seen in the {\cb Cross
Section} view.

In addition to the layers that describe material geometry, the
interface can make use of a masking layer.  This allows only certain
specified parts of the current cell to be evaluated.  When present,
geometry is clipped to objects on this layer before being processed in
the interface.

By default, a layer named {\vt FCAP} with purpose {\vt drawing} is
assumed for the masking layer.  Such a layer should be defined in the
technology file.  It should be given a GDSII mapping to allow saving

alternative, the {\et FcLayerName} variable can be set to the name of
another layer, which will instead provide the masking function.

\subsubsection{Output File}

The output file is a unified {\it FasterCap} list file.  At the top of
the file is a comment containing the layer sequence.  For example:

    <p>
    The panel functionality is divided into three pages, selectable
    through the tabs along the top of the window.  Common to all pages
    is a <b>Help</b> button, status line, and <b>Dismiss</b> button. 
    The status line indicates the number of background extraction jobs
    currently running.

    <a name="run"></a>
    <h2>The Run Page</h2>

    The <b>Run</b> page contains controls for running the supported
    programs, or creating unified list format input files for these
    programs.  This is the default page, shown when the panel appears.

    <p>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>Run in foreground</b><dd>
    At the top of the page is the <b>Run in foreground</b> check box. 
    When checked, the program will run synchronously in the
    foreground, rather than asynchronously in the background.  Aside
    from possibly being helpful when debugging problems, it is not
    clear that this mode has any value.

    href="FcForeg"><b>FcForeg</b></a> variable.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Out to console</b><dd>
    When the <b>Out to console</b> check box is checked, the program
    output will be printed in the console window, i.e., the shell
    window from which <i>Xic</i> is running.  This is most useful with
    <i>FasterCap</i>, which iterates to a solution, and the user can
    verify that all is well by watching this output.

    <p>
    This check box sets, and is set by, the <a
    href="FcMonitor"><b>FcMonitor</b></a> variable.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Show Numbers</b><dd>
    When the interface is run to produce an input file, the mutually
    connected conducting shapes are identified, and each disjoint
    group is assigned a conductor number.  These numbers are used in
    the input list file to specify the conductors, and in the output
    file to identify the capacitance matrix indices.

    <p>
    When this check box is checked, the conductor numbers will be
    shown on-screen, so that the user can easily determine the
    conductor numbers associated with the layout objects.  Each number
    is shown as a mark, which will appear at a corner of an object in
    the conductor group.  The conductor number, and the layer name of
    the associated object, are printed next to the cross-mark.

    <p>
    Note that due to the possibility of clipping by an <a
    href="fcinterf#geom"><tt>FCAP</tt></a> layer, objects that are
    connected in the cell may be disconnected when used in the
    interface.  In that case, two or more marks may appear over the
    same object, or different objects that are touching.  If this is
    confusing, one can use the <a href="xic:lexpr"><b>Layer
    Expression</b></a> panel from the <b>Edit Menu</b> to create
    temporary layers for visualization, consisting of the conducting
    layers <b>and</b>ed with the <tt>FCAP</tt> layer.  The resulting
    shapes will have unique conductor number marks.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Run File</b><dd>
    This button and adjacent text entry allows an arbitrary input file
    to be run by the capacitance extraction program currently
    configured.  The text area should contain a path to a valid input
    file for the configured program.  The program will run, and
    results will appear, as for a normal extraction run.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Run Extraction</b><dd>
    This button will dump a temporary input file, run the program, and
    display the results.  The result file is named
    <i>cellname</i>-<i>pid</i><tt>.fc_log</tt>, where
    <i>cellname</i> is the name of the current cell, and <i>pid</i>
    is the process id of the spawned process used to run the program. 
    The file contains listings of the input file produced by the
    interface and the output file produced by the program.

    <p>
    By default, the program is run in the background.  The label at
    the bottom of the panel will indicate that the job is running. 
    When complete, a <b>File Browser</b> window containing the result
    file will appear.  While jobs are running in the background, one
    can continue using <i>Xic</i>.

    <p>
    If the <a href="FcForeg"><b>FcForeg</b></a> variable is set, from
    the <b>Run in foreground</b> check box or with the <a
    href="!set"><b>!set</b></a> command, then the program will instead
    run in the foreground.  In this case, the result file is named
    <i>cellname</i><tt>.fc_log</tt>, and <i>Xic</i> will be
    unresponsive until the run completes.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Dump Unified List File</b><dd>
    This button allows an input file to be generated, which is in a
    unified list format compatible with the supported programs.  The
    default name for this file is <i>cellname</i><tt>.lst</tt>, where
    <i>cellname</i> is the current cell name.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>FcArgs</b><dd>
    This text entry area can be given a string, which will be included
    in the argument list when the program is run with the <b>Run
    Extraction</b> button.  This allows specialized command line
    options to be provided during the run, which the user may require. 
    This entry field is tied to the <a href="FcArgs"><b>FcArgs</b></a>
    variable.

    <p>
    If the interface detects that <i>FasterCap</i> from
    <tt>FastFieldSolvers.com</tt> is being used, and this entry is
    empty, the default argument string
    <blockquote>
    <tt>-b -a0.01</tt>
    </blockquote>
    will be imposed.  A "<tt>-b</tt>" option will always be added if
    missing from the <i>FasterCap</i> arguments list, as this argument
    is necessary for correct <i>FasterFap</i> operation in this mode. 
    The "<tt>-a</tt>" option is almost always used, as it specifies
    auto-refinement, however it is technically not necessary and won't
    be imposed if not given, except in the case where no arguments are
    given at all.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Path to FasterCap or FastCap-WR</b><dd>
    Near the bottom of the page is an entry area where the path to the
    <i>FasterCap</i> or <i>FastCap-WR</i> executable program can be
    edited.  This entry area displays and sets the <a
    href="FcPath"><b>FcPath</b></a> variable.
    </dl>

    <a name="params"></a>
    <h2>The Params Page</h2>

    <img src="screenshots/cex2.png" align=right>
    The upper half of this page provides entry areas for parameters
    used by the interface related to the substrate, plus a menu for
    choosing the units to use in the list file.

    <dl>
    <dt><b>SubstrateThickness</b><dd>
    This sets the assumed substrate thickness in microns.  When the
    thickness is nonzero, the substrate bottom and sides are assumed
    to abut vacuum permittivity.  When the thickness is set to zero,
    the substrate is assumed to completely fill the half-space below
    the extraction area.

    <p>
    This entry sets, and is set by, the <a
    href="SubstrateThickness"><b>SubstrateThickness</b></a>
    variable.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>FcPlaneBloat</b><dd>
    This entry contains a length, in microns.  If nonzero, horizontal
    dielectric/vacuum interface panels will extend outside of the <a
    href="fcinterf#geom">area of interest (AOI)</a> along the top
    surface of the substrate.  The extension distance is the
    <b>FcPlaneBloat</b> distance. 

    <p>
    When the <b>SubstrateThickness</b> is nonzero, the substrate
    bounding box, which is the AOI, will be bloated by this value
    before writing of the substrate bottom and side interface panels
    to the list file.  This will move the abrupt dielectric change at
    the substrate edge away from the area of interest.

    <p>
    If the <b>SubstrateThickness</b> is zero the <b>FcPlaneBloat</b>
    distance should be large enough to represent "infinity", but
    making it too large will slow down computation.  The model is
    approximating the entire half-space filled with substrate
    dielectric material.

    <p>
    This entry sets, and is set by, the <a
    href="FcPlaneBloat"><b>FcPlaneBloat</b></a> variable.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>SubstrateEps</b><dd>
    This entry supplies the relative dielectric constant asssumed for
    the substrate.  This sets, and is set by, the <a
    href="SubstrateEps"><b>SubstrateEps</b></a> variable.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>FcUnits</b><dd>
    This is an option menu which is used to set the length units used
    in files produced by the interface.  Choices are meters,
    centimeters, millimeters, microns (the default), inches, and mils. 
    The selection, if not the default, will set the <a
    href="FcUnits"><b>FcUnits</b></a> variable.  Similarly, setting
    the variable with the <a href="!set"><b>!set</b></a> command will
    update the state of the menu.  The choice currently in effect will
    be applied when input files are generated.  The choice of units
    will not affect the computed capacitance.
    </dl>

    <p>
    The lower half of the page allows one to crudely refine the raw
    panels while being written to the list file.  This is specifically
    for <i>FasterCap-WR</i>, which requires refined panelization for
    accuracy.  The <i>FasterCap</i> program does not require external
    refinement, which is a major advantage.  In fact, the refinement
    provided here should <b>not</b> be used with <i>FasterCap</i>,
    as it may interfere with <i>FasterCap</i>'s refinement.

    <p>
    The refinement is "crude" due to each refined panel being
    approximately the same size.  If the size is small enough,
    sufficient spatial resolution for accurate capacitance calculation
    is achieved.  This resolution is needed along edges, and at
    corners, where there are strong field gradients, but is gross
    overkill for most areas.  Since the solving time is
    related to the total number of refined panels, this type of
    refinement is very inefficient with respect to memory use and
    execution speed.

    <p>
    The refinement works as follows.  First, the interface computes
    the total area of all conductor and dielectric raw panels that
    would be output to the list file.  This area is divided by the
    <b>FcPanelTarget</b> number provided by the user.  This is a
    number approximating the total refined panel count that
    <i>FastCap-WR</i> will need to process.  The solution time should
    be approximately the same for the same panel count, independent of
    the actual geometry.  The square root of the divided area is used
    when writing the panels to the list file.  The raw panels are
    subdivided so that no panel edge is longer than this value.

    <p>
    A number like 10000 is probably about right for the
    <b>FcPanelTarget</b> in providing decent accuracy in a reasonable
    execution time.  Larger numbers provide more accuracy, but require
    larger files and have longer solution time.  The list file will
    contain a line for each refined panel.  The entry area will take
    numbers up to 1e6, which is probably unreasonable for a normal
    computer.
    
    <dl>
    <dt><b>Enable</b><dd>
    This check box will enable or disable the refinement.  This should
    not be active when using <i>FasterCap</i>.  When pressed, the
    <b>FcPanelTarget</b> entry will become un-grayed, and internally
    the <a href="FcPanelTarget"><b>FcPanelTarget</b></a> variable will
    be set to to the number shown in the <b>FcPanelTarget</b> entry
    area.  When the <b>Enable</b> button is set inactive, the
    <b>FcPanelTarget</b> variable is unset.  The <b>Enable</b> button
    state will reflect whether or not the <b>FcPanelTarget</b>
    variable is set.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><b>FcPanelTarget</b><dd>
    This entry area is seensitive only when the <b>Enable</b> check
    box is checked.  It tracks the value of the <b>FcPanelTarget</b>
    variable, which can be set to a real value of 1e3 - 1e6.  This
    will be the approximate number of refined panels generated in the
    list file.

    <h2>The Jobs Page</h2>

    <p>
    <img src="screenshots/cex3.png" align=right>
    The <b>Jobs</b> page contains a list of running background jobs.
    Each entry provides the process identification number (PID), the
    name of the executing program, and the local date and time when

    <p>
    When an entry is selected, the <b>Abort job</b> button below the

    confirmation and no ability to resume the run.
!!LATEX fcpanel extract.tex
This panel, brought up by the {\cb Extract C} button in the {\cb
Extract Menu}, controls the interface to external capacitance
extraction programs described above.  The interface can also be
controlled to a large extent with the {\cb !fc} prompt line command.

The panel functionality is divided into three pages, selectable
through the tabs along the top of the window.  Common to all pages is
a {\cb Help} button, status line, and {\cb Dismiss} button.  The
status line indicates the number of background extraction jobs
currently running.

%-----------------------------------
\subsubsection{The Run Page}

The {\cb Run} page contains controls for running the supported
programs, or creating unified list format input files for these
programs.  This is the default page, shown when the panel appears.

\begin{description}
\item{\cb Run in foreground}\\
At the top of the page is the {\cb Run in foreground} check box.  When
checked, the program will run synchronously in the foreground, rather
than asynchronously in the background.  Aside from possibly being
helpful when debugging problems, it is not clear that this mode has
any value.

This check box sets, and is set by, the {\et FcForeg} variable.

\item{\cb Out to console}\\
When the {\cb Out to console} check box is checked, the program output
will be printed in the console window, i.e., the shell window from
which {\Xic} is running.  This is most useful with {\it FasterCap},
which iterates to a solution, and the user can verify that all is well
by watching this output.

This check box sets, and is set by, the {\et FcMonitor} variable.

\item{\cb Show Numbers}\\
When the interface is run to produce an input file, the mutually
connected conducting shapes are identified, and each disjoint group is
assigned a conductor number.  These numbers are used in the input list
file to specify the conductors, and in the output file to identify the
capacitance matrix indices.

When this check box is checked, the conductor numbers will be shown
on-screen, so that the user can easily determine the conductor numbers
associated with the layout objects.  Each number is shown as a
cross-mark, which will appear at a corner of an object in the
conductor group.  The conductor number, and the layer name of the
associated object, are printed next to the cross-mark.

Note that due to the possibility of clipping by an {\vt FCAP} layer,
objects that are connected in the cell may be disconnected when used
in the interface.  In that case, two or more marks may appear over the
same object, or different objects that are touching.  If this is
confusing, one can use the {\cb Layer Expression} panel from the {\cb
Edit Menu} to create temporary layers for visualization, consisting of
the conducting layers {\bf and}ed with the {\vt FCAP} layer.  The
resulting shapes will have unique conductor number marks.

\item{\cb Run File}\\
This button and adjacent text entry allows an arbitrary input file to
be run by the capacitance extraction program currently configured. 
The text area should contain a path to a valid input file for the
configured program.  The program will run, and results will appear, as
for a normal extraction run.

\item{\cb Run Extraction}\\
This button will dump a temporary input file, run the program, and
display the results.  The result file is named {\it cellname\/}-{\it
pid\/}{\vt .fc\_log}, where {\it cellname} is the name of the current
cell, and {\it pid} is the process id of the spawned process used to
run the program.  The file contains listings of the input file
produced by the interface and the output file produced by the program.

By default, the program is run in the background.  The label at the
bottom of the panel will indicate that the job is running.  When
complete, a {\cb File Browser} window containing the result file will
appear.  While jobs are running in the background, one can continue
using {\Xic}.

If the {\et FcForeg} variable is set, from the {\cb Run in foreground}
check box or with the {\cb !set} command, then the program will
instead run in the foreground.  In this case, the result file is named
{\it cellname\/}{\vt .fc\_log}, and {\Xic} will be unresponsive until
the run completes.

\item{\cb Dump Unified List File}\\
This button allows an input file to be generated, which is in a
unified list format compatible with the supported programs.  The
default name for this file is {\it cellname\/}{\vt .lst}, where {\it
cellname} is the current cell name.

\item{\cb FcArgs}\\
This text entry area can be given a string, which will be included in
the argument list when the program is run with the {\cb Run
Extraction} button.  This allows specialized command line options to
be provided during the run, which the user may require.  This entry
field is tied to the {\et FcArgs} variable.

If the interface detects that {\it FasterCap} from {\vt
FastFieldSolvers.com} is being used, and this entry is empty, the
default argument string
\begin{quote}\vt
-b -a0.01
\end{quote}
will be imposed.  A ``{\vt -b}'' option will always be added if
missing from the {\it FasterCap} arguments list, as this argument is
necessary for correct {\it FasterFap} operation in this mode.  The
``{\vt -a}'' option is almost always used, as it specifies
auto-refinement, however it is technically not necessary and won't be
imposed if not given, except in the case where no arguments are given
at all.

\item{\cb Path to FasterCap or FastCap-WR}\\
Near the bottom of the page is an entry area where the path to the
executable program can be edited.  This entry area displays and sets
the {\et FcPath} variable.
\end{description}

%-----------------------------------
\subsubsection{The Params page}

The upper half of this page provides entry areas for parameters used
by the interface related to the substrate, plus a menu for choosing
the units to use in the list file.

\begin{description}
\item{\cb SubstrateThickness}\\
This sets the assumed substrate thickness in microns.  When the
thickness is nonzero, the substrate bottom and sides are assumed to
abut vacuum permittivity.  When the thickness is set to zero, the
substrate is assumed to completely fill the half-space below the
extraction area.

This entry sets, and is set by, the {\et SubstrateThickness} variable.

\item{\cb FcPlaneBloat}\\
This entry contains a length, in microns.  If nonzero, horizontal
dielectric/vacuum interface panels will extend outside of the area of
interest (AOI, see \ref{subsaoi}) along the top surface of the
substrate.  The extension distance is the {\et FcPlaneBloat} distance.

When the {\et SubstrateThickness} is nonzero, the substrate bounding
box, which is the AOI, will be bloated by this value before writing of
the substrate bottom and side interface panels to the list file.  This
will move the abrupt dielectric change at the substrate edge away from
the area of interest.

If the {\et SubstrateThickness} is zero the {\et FcPlaneBloat}
distance should be large enough to represent ``infinity'', but making
it too large will slow down computation.  The model is approximating
the entire half-space filled with substrate dielectric material. 

This entry sets, and is set by, the {\et FcPlaneBloat} variable.

\item{\cb SubstrateEps}\\
This entry supplies the relative dielectric constant asssumed for the
substrate.  This sets, and is set by, the {\et SubstrateEps} variable.

\item{\cb FcUnits}\\
This is an option menu which is used to set the length units used in
files produced by the interface.  Choices are meters, centimeters,
millimeters, microns (the default), inches, and mils.  The selection,
if not the default, will set the {\et FxUnits} variable.  Similarly,
setting the variable with the {\cb !set} command will update the state
of the menu.  The choice currently in effect will be applied when
input files are generated.  The choice of units will not affect the
computed capacitance.
\end{description}

The lower half of the page allows one to crudely refine the raw panels
while being written to the list file.  This is specifically for {\it
FasterCap-WR}, which requires refined panelization for accuracy.  The
{\it FasterCap} program does not require external refinement, which is
a major advantage.  In fact, the refinement provided here should {\bf
not} be used with {\it FasterCap}, as it may interfere with {\it
FasterCap\/}'s refinement.

The refinement is ``crude'' due to each refined panel being
approximately the same size.  If the size is small enough, sufficient
spatial resolution for accurate capacitance calculation is achieved. 
This resolution is needed along edges, and at corners, where there are
strong field gradients, but is gross overkill for most areas.  Since
the solving time is related to the total number of refined panels,
this type of refinement is very inefficient with respect to memory use
and execution speed.

The refinement works as follows.  First, the interface computes the
total area of all conductor and dielectric raw panels that would be
output to the list file.  This area is divided by the {\cb
FcPanelTarget} number provided by the user.  This is a number
approximating the total refined panel count that {\it FastCap-WR} will
need to process.  The solution time should be approximately the same
for the same panel count, independent of the actual geometry.  The
square root of the divided area is used when writing the panels to the
list file.  The raw panels are subdivided so that no panel edge is
longer than this value.

A number like 10000 is probably about right for the {\cb
FcPanelTarget} in providing decent accuracy in a reasonable execution
time.  Larger numbers provide more accuracy, but require larger files
and have longer solution time.  The list file will contain a line for
each refined panel.  The entry area will take numbers up to 1e6, which
is probably unreasonable for a normal computer.
 
\begin{description}
\item{\cb Enable}\\
This check box will enable or disable the refinement.  This should
not be active when using {\it FasterCap}.  When pressed, the {\cb
FcPanelTarget} entry will become un-grayed, and internally the {\et
FcPanelTarget} variable will be set to the number shown in the
{\cb FcPanelTarget} entry area.  When the {\cb Enable} button is set
inactive, the {\et FcPanelTarget} variable is unset.  The {\cb Enable}
button state will reflect whether or not the {\et FcPanelTarget}
variable is set.

\item{\cb FcPanelTarget}\\
This entry area is seensitive only when the {\cb Enable} check box is
checked.  It tracks the value of the {\et FcPanelTarget} variable,
which can be set to a real value of 1e3 -- 1e6.  This will be the
approximate number of refined panels generated in the list file. 
\end{description}

%-----------------------------------
\subsubsection{The Jobs page}

The {\cb Jobs} page contains a list of running background jobs.  Each
entry provides the process identification number (PID), the name of
the executing program, and the local date and time when started. 
Entries can be selected by clicking with the mouse.

When an entry is selected, the {\cb Abort job} button below the list
becomes un-grayed.  Clicking this button will terminate the selected
process.  The user should consider that there is no confirmation and
no ability to resume the run.

    <p>
    The interface uses an external program to extract inductance and
    resistance values along conducting features in the layout.  The
    interface currently supports the original <i>FastHenry</i> program
    from MIT, and (presumably) all input format compatible successor
    and derivative programs that can be run from a command line.

    <ul>
    <li><b>FastHenry-WR</b> from Whiteley Research.
    The program is available available in the <a
    href="http://wrcad.com/freestuff.html">free software archive</a>
    on the Whiteley Research web site.  This package has been updated
    to build easily with newer compilers.  It has been extended to
    support superconductors, and incorporates features to accelerate
    computation.

    <p>
    <li><b>FastHenry</b> from <a
    href="http://www.rle.mit.edu/cpg/research_codes.htm">MIT</b></a>. 
    This is the original <i>FastHenry</i> three-dimensional inductance
    extraction program.
    </ul>

    <p>
    This is the second generation interface to <i>FastHenry</i>.  The
    original extraction interface, found in releases 4.0.8 and
    earlier, was quite a bit more complicated.  The present interface
    affords at least the following simplifications:

    <ul>
    <li>The interface presently takes material from the current cell
    as input, there is no need to select and save things into the
    interface.
    <p>
    <li>There is no "dataset name", the file names use the current
    cell name as a base name.
    <p>
    <li>There is no longer a graphical "partition editor".  This was
    too cumbersome.  Instead, a simple automatic refinement provision
    is included.  It is hoped that one day auto-refinement will be
    built into a <i>FastHenry</i> successor program, as was done in
    the <i>FasterCap</i> program from <tt>fastfieldsolvers.com</tt>.
    <p>
    <li>There is no longer a graphical terminal definition editor.
    Instead, a special layer is used to define terminal areas.
    </ul>

    The new interface, however, is much more flexible and powerful
    than the original interface.
    <ul>
    <li>There is no longer a fixed assumption that layers are planar,
    or that layer ordering must begin with a conductor and alternate
    with insulators.  Layers can appear in any order, and any layer
    can be planarizing, or not.  If a layer is planarizing, it will
    have variable thickness such that the top surface is in one plane.

    <p>
    <li>There is a new <a href="xic:ldb3d">layer-sequencing engine</a>
    that is also used by the <a href="xic:csect"><b>Cross
    Section</b></a> display command (in the <b>View Menu</b>), as well
    as for <a href="fcinterf">capacitance extraction</a>.  Thus, the
    cross section display will always faithfully represent the
    assumptions used in the interface.  Layer ordering is basically
    that shown in the <a href="layertab">layer table</a>, though
    <tt>Via</tt> layers are allowed to be out of sequence (likely for
    drawing visibility reasons).  The "real" position of a
    <tt>Via</tt> layer can be obtained from the layers it references.

    <p>
    <li>Geometry is taken from the current cell, to all levels of the
    hierarchy.  There is provision for use of a special masking layer. 
    If this layer is found in the layout, geometry will be clipped to
    the patterning on this layer.
    </ul>

    <a name="geom"></a>
    <h2>Geometry Construction</h2>

    By default, a layer named "<tt>FHRY</tt>" will serve as the
    masking layer.  If, however, the <a
    href="FhLayerName"><b>FhLayerName</b></a> variable is set to a
    layer name, that layer will provide the masking function.  We will
    refer to this layer as the "mask layer".

    <p>
    If no objects are found on the mask layer, all geometry in the
    current cell will be treated in the interface.  Be advised that
    the inductance/resistance extraction will very rapidly become
    untenable if too much geometry is included.  The interface itself
    is not designed to handle large object collections, though it will
    remain snappy while generating files that may take weeks to run. 
    More than 100 objects is probably pushing things.  The effective
    area of interest (AOI) is the bounding box of the current cell.

    <p>
    If objects are found on the mask layer, then the mask layer
    pattern is <b>and</b>ed with the other layers, and the resulting
    geometry is processed by the interface.  The bounding box of the
    mask layer patterning becomes the effective AOI, which can be
    much smaller than the cell bounding box.  In any case, the AOI
    bounds all geometry in the problem.

    <p>
    The geometry is as shown in the drawing window, though geometry is
    saved in an internal representation that removes any overlap of
    objects in the original layout.  Outside of the AOI, and above all
    geometry and below the substrate, empty space is assumed.

    <p>
    The geometric specification of conductors to <i>FastHenry</i>
    consists of "node" definitions, and the definition of "segments"
    that connect the nodes.  The nodes are points in three-dimensional
    space, and touch or are enclosed in conducting objects.  Once the
    node locations are assigned, the connecting segments are created. 
    Nodes and segments that dead-end are removed, the remaining nodes
    and segments can be thought of as a three-dimensional SPICE net,
    where the segments represent inductors.  We compute the overall
    inductance between different "terminals" of the network.

    <p>
    The interface works by tiling.  This assumes that current can flow
    in any direction.  A tile is a rectangular prism, with a node in
    the center, and a node at the center of each of the six faces. 
    Segments, whose dimensions are set by the tile size, connect the
    central node with each of the face nodes.  In order for adjacent
    tiles to make contact, the face nodes of the adjacent faces must
    coincide.  This will be true if the conducting objects are
    decomposed into tiles properly, avoiding corners that are adjacent
    to an edge.  The decomposition is performed along the X, Y, and Z
    directions.  Tiles with a side longer than a given maximum dimension
    will be subdivided.

    <p>
    This is the appropriate way to handle three-dimensional current
    flow through constrictions such as vias, and account for
    penetration or skin depth.  However, <i>FastHenry</i> was
    originally set up to handle long, thin conductors where the
    current flow is assumed to be in a fixed direction.  Most of the
    examples use this approach, and use flags that internally
    subdivide the segments transverse to current flow.  This provides
    suitable accuracy and good efficiency for certain types of
    problems.

    <p>
    When the full three-dimensional decomposition is used, the problem
    size can quickly grow to the point where <i>FastHenry</i> can not
    provide a solution in a reasonable amount of time.  Approximations
    must be employed at this point to reduce segment count.  To a much
    greater extent that for capacitance extraction, the user may have
    to intervene to fine-tune the process.

    <p>
    The ability to tile requires that the geometry be Manhattan. 
    Support for non-Manhattan geometry is provided by first internally
    Manhattanizing non-Manhattan objects before processing.  The
    granularity of the Manhattanization is controlled by the <a
    href="FhManhGridCnt"><b>FhManhGridCnt</b></a> variable or the
    corresponding text entry field in the <b>LR Extraction</b> panel
    <b>Params</b> page.  The length of a Manhattan segment used to
    approximate non-Manhattan geometry must be larger than
    <tt>sqrt(</tt><i>area_of_interest</i><tt>FhManhGridCnt)</tt>. Using
    <b>FhManhFridCnt</b> values larger than the default 1000 will
    increase accuracy, but this can dramatically increase the
    segment count, and therefor <i>FastHenry</i> run time.  When
    possible, non-Manhattan features should be avoided when using this
    interface to <i>FastHenry</i>.

    <a name="terms"></a>
    <h2>Terminal Definition</h2>

    Terminals are the assumed external contact points used when
    extracting the inductance matrix.  Unlike capacitance extraction,
    inductance and resistance extraction requires terminal
    definitions, and the results will depend fundamentally on the
    terminal locations.

    <p>
    Terminals are specified by creating boxes or polygons and labels
    on special layers.  The feature will define as equivalent all
    nodes that touch or are enclosed in the shape, for any Z
    coordinate (the features are in the X-Y plane).

    <p>
    Each terminal feature must have at least one overlapping text
    label on the same layer, that provides the terminal name. 
    Terminals must resolve to pairs, where each pair is a "port",
    taking the inductance matrix as an N-port network.  The pair is
    ordered, with one terminal being the "plus" terminal, the other
    the "minus" terminal.

    <p>
    This is all accomplished by adherence to the following rules.

    <ol>
    <li>The features (boxes or polygons) and labels which equivalence
    nodes and define terminals are created on special layers.  The
    layer name is the same as the layer name of the conductor which
    provides the nodes.  The purpose name is the special keyword
    "<tt>fhterm</tt>".  Thus for example, for a metal layer named
    "<tt>M1</tt>" (which has the default "<tt>drawing</tt>" purpose)
    the corresponding special layer has the full layer-purpose pair
    (LPP) name "<tt>M1:fhterm</tt>".  Such a LPP should be defined for
    each conducting layer in the technology file.

    <li>Terminal features must touch or enclose at least one node. 
    Nodes can be found at the center of each edge of each tile.  When
    connecting to the end of a metal strip, for example, the entire
    transverse width of the strip end should be enclosed in or touch
    the terminal feature, so that current flow is uniform.

    <li>Each terminal feature must have at least one overlapping text
    label on the same layer giving a terminal name.

    <li>Each terminal is one of a pair, the pair representing a port.
    The terminals of each pair must contact the same conductor group,
    i.e., be connected.

    <li>It is possible for a terminal to be used in more than one port,
    in which case the terminal will have more than one overlapping label.

    <li>Port-terminal association is by name.  Name labels must follow
    these rules:
    <ol>
    <li>Terminal names consist of a port name and a suffix.  If the
    name string contains punctuation or white space, the first
    occurrence of such is stripped, and the port name is taken as the
    characters to the left, and the suffix is taken as the characters
    to the right, of where the punctuation or white space resided.  If
    there is no punctuation or white space, the port name is the name
    string with the rightmost character stripped, and the suffix is
    this character.  The port name and suffix must each contain at
    least one printable character or a fatal error results.  The port
    name is arbitrary, but must be unique among the ports.

    <li>Both terminals of a port must have the same port name, case
    sensitive.  It is a fatal error if a terminal can not be paired.

    <li>Both terminals of a port must have different suffixes.  The
    suffix is used only to order the terminals in the port.  This is
    done using lexicographic ordering of the suffix strings.  Beyond
    ordering, the suffix is ignored.  It is a fatal error if the
    suffixes are the same.

    <li>Both terminals of a port must contact the same conductor group.
    </ol>

    <li>For each terminal feature, a list of intersecting nodes is
    created internally.  The first node in the list is taken as the
    reference.  If there are additional nodes, they are equivalenced
    to the reference node, using the <i>FastHenry</i>
    "<tt>.equiv</tt>" construct.

    <li>For each port, a <i>FastHenry</i> "<tt>.extern</tt>" construct
    is used to provide the reference nodes of the two terminals in order,
    followed by the port name.
    </ol>

    <a name="tech"></a>
    <h2>Technology File Setup</h2>

    Setup parallels setup of the <a href="xic:ldb3d">three-dimensional
    layer sequence database</a>, which in turn follows setup of the <a
    href="ext:setup">extraction system</a>.  These sections should be
    consulted for detailed setup information, here we provide some
    supplemental information.

    <p>
    To the interface, there are two different materials:
    <dl>
    <dt>conductors<dd>
    Conductors will have one of the following:
    <ol>
    <li>Any of the <a href="Conductor"><tt>Conductor</tt></a>,
    <a href="Routing"><tt>Routing</tt></a>, <a
    href="GroundPlane"><tt>GroundPlane</tt></a>, <a
    href="GroundPlaneClear"><tt>GroundPlaneClear</tt></a>, or <a
    href="Contact"><tt>Contact</tt></a> technology file keywords (or
    their aliases) applied.  All of these implicitly give the
    <tt>Conductor</tt> keyword.

    <p>
    <li>Any of the <a href="Rsh"><tt>Rsh</tt></a>, <a
    href="Rho"><tt>Rho</tt></a>, <a href="Sigma"><tt>Sigma</tt></a>,
    or <a href="Lambda"><tt>Lambda</tt></a> keywords applied with a
    positive value.
    </ol>
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt>insulators<dd>
    Insulators will have one of the
    <a href="Dielectric"><tt>Dielectric</tt></a>
    or <a href="Via"><tt>Via</tt></a> keywords applied, and also the
    <a href="EpsRel"><tt>EpsRel</tt></a> keyword applied with a value
    of 1.0 or larger.
    </dl>

    In addition, layers that are to be used in the interface as conductors
    or insulators must have all of the following:
    <ul>
    <li>A <a href="Thickness"><tt>Thickness</tt></a> keyword applied with a
    value greater than zero.
    <li>Must be visible in the layer table.
    <li>Must not have the <a href="Symbolic"><tt>Symbolic</tt></a>
    keyword applied.
    </ul>

    <p>
    Conductor layers can have the following optional keywords defined. 
    These control the filamentation of conductor layers carrying
    current in the plane of the substrate, in the direction normal to
    the substrate.  This accounts for penetration or skin depth in
    planar areas of material, in the Z direction.  Typically, for
    superconductors at least, lateral dimensions are much larger than
    film thicknesses, so the volume element refinement tends to keep
    the film thinkness unbroken in the Z direction.  For accurate
    account of the penetration depth, this should be further
    subdivided, and filamentation is one way to accomplish this.

    <ul>
    <li>A <a href="FH_nhinc"><tt>FH_nhinc</tt></a> keyword with an
    integer value greater than one can be applied.  This is the number
    of filaments into which the segment will be divided, along the
    normal to the substrate.  See the <i>FastHenry</i> documentation
    for more information about the <tt>nhinc</tt> parameter which can
    be applied to segment definitions.

    <li>A <a href="FH_rh"><tt>FH_rh</tt></a> keyword with a real value
    different from the default value of 2.0 can be given.  When the
    filament count is larger than 2, filaments have varying height so
    as to maximize the density at the film surfaces.  This parameter
    sets the ratio of heights between adjacent filaments.  A value of
    1.0 means that all filaments have the same height.  See the
    <i>FastHenry</i> documentation for more discussion and information
    about the <tt>rh</tt> parameter.
    </ul>

    <p>
    The conductor layers can be given a resistivity or conductivity
    with the <tt>Rho</tt> and <tt>Sigma</tt> keywords, respectively. 
    Additionally, the <tt>Lambda</tt> parameter, which specifies the
    London penetration depth for superconductors, can be specified. 
    This is for the convenience of <i>Xic</i> users in the
    superconducting electronics R&D community.  In this case,
    <tt>Rho/Sigma</tt> specify the unpaired conductivity from the
    two-fluid model.

    <p>
    The <tt>Dielectric</tt> technology file keyword was added to
    support capacitance extraction.  This is intended to model an
    explicit capacitor dielectric, and differs from <tt>Via</tt>
    layers in the following ways.
    <ul>
    <li>Unlike <tt>Via</tt>, it is not assumed to be dark field (but
    <a href="DarkField"><tt>DarkField</tt></a> can be applied to the
    layer explicitly).
    <li>Only one <tt>Dielectric</tt> keyword can appear per layer
    (multiple <tt>Via</tt> keywords are allowed).
    <li>Stacking order is as shown in the layer table (<tt>Via</tt>
    layers are allowed to appear out of order).
    <li><tt>Dielectric</tt> layers are not planarizing by default,
    <tt>Via</tt> layers are.
    </ul>

    <p>
    The present interface can take layers in any order.  This is in
    contrast with the original interface, that required layers to
    alternate conductor/insulator starting with a conductor, and
    ordering was obtained entirely from <tt>Via</tt> references and
    not the layer table order.

    <p>
    After all possible layers from the layer table are sequenced,
    layers that are not used in the extracted geometry are discarded. 
    Note that dark-field layers are inverted, as we are interested in
    representing the physical material.  Thus, for example no
    structure in a <tt>Via</tt> layer (i.e., no vias) in the layout
    implies the presence of a continuous film of insulating material,
    so the layer is actually present.

    <p>
    The same layer sequencer is used in the <a
    href="xic:csect"><b>Cross Section</b></a> command in the <b>View
    Menu</b>.  The cross section display and the interface will always
    agree on the ordering and planarization of the layers.  This was
    not true with the original interface.

    <p>
    In addition to the layers that describe material geometry, the
    interface can make use of a <a href="fhinterf#geom">masking
    layer<a>.  This allows only certain specified parts of the current
    cell to be evaluated.  When present, geometry is clipped to
    objects on this layer before being processed in the interface.

    <p>
    By default, a layer named <tt>FHRY</tt> with purpose
    <tt>drawing</tt> is assumed for the masking layer.  Such a layer
    should be defined in the technology file.  It should be given a
    GDSII mapping to allow saving of work containing the layer to
    GDSII or OASIS files.  As an alternative, the <a
    href="FhLayerName"><b>FhLayerName</b></a> variable can be set to
    the name of another layer, which will instead provide the masking
    function.

    <p>
    Finally, the layers used in terminal definitions should be
    configured into the technology file.  Generally, there is an
    <i>Xic</i> layer corresponding to each conducting layer, with a
    purpose name "<tt>fhterm</tt>" and the same base layer name.  In
    order to save the layout with terminals as GDSII or OASIS, a GDSII
    layer mapping should be applied for these layers.

    <a name="output"></a>
    <h2>Output File</h2>

    The output file is a <i>FastHenry</i> input file, with format as
    documented in the original <i>FastHenry</i> manual, potentially
    with the extensions for superconductivity support (<tt>lambda</tt>
    specifications) if the <a href="Lambda"><tt>Lambda</tt></a>
    parameter is given to any layer used (making it a superconductor). 
    Such constructs are <b>not</b> compatible with the original MIT
    <i>FastHenry</i>, but require the Whiteley Research version, or a
    derivative.

    <p>
    At the top of the file is a comment containing the layer sequence. 
    For example:

    <p>
    <pre>
    * Layers           Plane        Thickness    EpsRel
    * Substrate                     75.000       11.900
    * Insulator CO     0.000        0.190        4.200
    * Insulator VIA1   0.190        0.095        2.900
    * Insulator VIA2   0.285        0.095        2.900
    * Insulator VIA3   0.380        0.095        2.900
    * Conductor M4     0.475        0.220
    * Insulator VIA4   0.695        0.095        2.900
    * Conductor M5     0.790        0.220
    * Insulator VIA5   1.010        0.095        2.900
    * Conductor M6     1.105        0.220
    * Insulator VIA6   1.325        0.095        2.900
    * Insulator VIA7   1.420        0.610        4.200
    * Insulator VIA8   2.030        0.610        4.200
    </pre>

    <p>
    The <tt>Plane</tt> is the base elevation of the mask objects of a
    planarizing layer, that is, the top surface of the layer minus the
    layer thickness value.  This field will be empty for
    non-planarizing layers.

    <a name="tips"></a>
    <h2>Tips and Hints</h2>

    <ul>
    <li>It is easy to generate input files that take an excessively
    long time to run.  This is probably the most common pitfall.  The
    run time increases with increasing segment count.  The segment
    count is approximately proportional to the number of lines in the
    input file.

    <p>
    <li>Non-Manhattan features can be very bad news.  These are
    "Manhattanized" by converting non-Manhattan edges into stepwise
    approximations.  The large number of edges that can be produced by
    this may lead te excessive run time.  The <b>FhManhGridCnt</b>
    entry in the <b>Params</b> page of the control panel can be
    decreased to reduce the number of segments.

    <p>
    <li>Too-few segments is also to be avoided, as the calculation may
    not be suitably accurate.  The <b>Volume Element Refinement</b>
    check box in the <b>Params</b> page should always be checked.  The
    entered number can be varied, the user should experiment.  Larger
    values should provide better accuracy at the expense of longer
    computation time.

    <p>
    <li>One should not try to extract "too much", due to the
    <i>FastHenry</i> limitations.  How much is too much
    depends on a lot a factors, the user should experiment to
    gain a feel for their process and computer hardware.
    </ul>
!!LATEX fhinterf extract.tex
The interface uses an external program to extract inductance and
resistance values along conducting features in the layout.  The
interface currently supports the original {\it FastHenry} program from
MIT, and (presumably) all input format compatible successor and
derivative programs that can be run from a command line.

\begin{itemize}
\item{{\bf FastHenry-WR} from Whiteley Research.  The program is
available available in the free software archive on the Whiteley
Research web site.  This package has been updated to build easily with
newer compilers.  It has been extended to support superconductors, and
incorporates features to accelerate computation.}

\item{{\bf FastHenry} from MIT.  This is the original {\it FastHenry}
three-dimensional inductance extraction program.}
\end{itemize}

This is the second generation interface to {\it FastHenry}.  The
original extraction interface, found in releases 4.0.8 and earlier,
was quite a bit more complicated.  The present interface affords at
least the following simplifications:

\begin{itemize}
\item{The interface presently takes material from the current cell
as input, there is no need to select and save things into the
interface.}

\item{There is no ``dataset name'', the file names use the current
cell name as a base name.}

\item{There is no longer a graphical ``partition editor''.  This was
too cumbersome.  Instead, a simple automatic refinement provision is
included.  It is hoped that one day auto-refinement will be built into
a {\it FastHenry} successor program, as was done in the {\it
FasterCap} program from {\vt fastfieldsolvers.com}.}

\item{There is no longer a graphical terminal definition editor. 
Instead, a special layer is used to define terminal areas.}
\end{itemize}

The new interface, however, is much more flexible and powerful than
the original interface.

\begin{itemize}
\item{There is no longer a fixed assumption that layers are planar, or
that layer ordering must begin with a conductor and alternate with
insulators.  Layers can appear in any order, and any layer can be
planarizing, or not.  If a layer is planarizing, it will have variable
thickness such that the top surface is in one plane.}

\item{There is a new layer-sequencing engine (see \ref{ldb3d}) that is
also used by the {\cb Cross Section} display command (in the {\cb View
Menu}), as well as for capacitance extraction.  Thus, the cross
section display will always faithfully represent the assumptions used
in the interface.  Layer ordering is basically that shown in the layer
table, though {\et Via} layers are allowed to be out of sequence
(likely for drawing visibility reasons).  The ``real'' position of a
{\et Via} layer can be obtained from the layers it references.}

\item{Geometry is taken from the current cell, to all levels of the
hierarchy.  There is provision for use of a special masking layer.  If
this layer is found in the layout, geometry will be clipped to the
patterning on this layer.}
\end{itemize}

%-----------------------------------
\subsubsection{Geometry Construction}

By default, a layer named ``{\vt FHRY}'' will serve as the masking
layer.  If, however, the {\et FhLayerName} variable is set to a layer
name, that layer will provide the masking function.  We will refer to
this layer as the ``mask layer''.

If no objects are found on the mask layer, all geometry in the current
cell will be treated in the interface.  Be advised that the
inductance/resistance extraction will very rapidly become untenable if
too much geometry is included.  The interface itself is not designed
to handle large object collections, though it will remain snappy while
generating files that may take weeks to run.  More than 100 objects is
probably pushing things.  The effective area of interest (AOI) is the
bounding box of the current cell.

If objects are found on the mask layer, then the mask layer pattern is
{\bf and}ed with the other layers, and the resulting geometry is
processed by the interface.  The bounding box of the mask layer
patterning becomes the effective AOI, which can be much smaller than
the cell bounding box.  In any case, the AOI bounds all geometry in
the problem.

The geometry is as shown in the drawing window, though geometry is
saved in an internal representation that removes any overlap of
objects in the original layout.  Outside of the AOI, and above all
geometry and below the substrate, empty space is assumed.

The geometric specification of conductors to {\it FastHenry} consists
of ``node'' definitions, and the definition of ``segments'' that
connect the nodes.  The nodes are points in three-dimensional space,
and touch or are enclosed in conducting objects.  Once the node
locations are assigned, the connecting segments are created.  Nodes
and segments that dead-end are removed, the remaining nodes and
segments can be thought of as a three-dimensional SPICE net, where the
segments represent inductors.  We compute the overall inductance
between different ``terminals'' of the network.

The interface works by tiling.  This assumes that current can flow in
any direction.  A tile is a rectangular prism, with a node in the
center, and a node at the center of each of the six faces.  Segments,
whose dimensions are set by the tile size, connect the central node
with each of the face nodes.  In order for adjacent tiles to make
contact, the face nodes of the adjacent faces must coincide.  This
will be true if the conducting objects are decomposed into tiles
properly, avoiding corners that are adjacent to an edge.  The
decomposition is performed along the X, Y, and Z directions.  Tiles
with a side longer than a given maximum dimension will be subdivided.

This is the appropriate way to handle three-dimensional current flow
through constrictions such as vias, and account for penetration or
skin depth.  However, {\it FastHenry} was originally set up to handle
long, thin conductors where the current flow is assumed to be in a
fixed direction.  Most of the examples use this approach, and use
flags that internally subdivide the segments transverse to current
flow.  This provides suitable accuracy and good efficiency for certain
types of problems.

When the full three-dimensional decomposition is used, the problem
size can quickly grow to the point where {\it FastHenry} can not
provide a solution in a reasonable amount of time.  Approximations
must be employed at this point to reduce segment count.  To a much
greater extent that for capacitance extraction, the user may have to
intervene to fine-tune the process.

The ability to tile requires that the geometry be Manhattan.  Support
for non-Manhattan geometry is provided by first internally
Manhattanizing non-Manhattan objects before processing.  The
granularity of the Manhattanization is controlled by the {\et
FhManhGridCnt} variable or the corresponding text entry field in the
{\cb LR Extraction} panel {\cb Params} page.  The length of a
Manhattan segment used to approximate non-Manhattan geometry must be
larger than {\vt sqrt(}{\it area\_of\_interest\/}{\vt FhManhGridCnt)}. 
Using {\et FhManhFridCnt} values larger than the default 1000 will
increase accuracy, but this can dramatically increase the segment
count, and therefor {\it FastHenry} run time.  When possible,
non-Manhattan features should be avoided when using this interface to
{\it FastHenry}.

%-----------------------------------
\subsubsection{Terminal Definition}

Terminals are the assumed external contact points used when extracting
the inductance matrix.  Unlike capacitance extraction, inductance and
resistance extraction requires terminal definitions, and the results
will depend fundamentally on the terminal locations.

Terminals are specified by creating boxes or polygons and labels on
special layers.  The feature will define as equivalent all nodes that
touch or are enclosed in the shape, for any Z coordinate (the features
are in the X-Y plane).

Each terminal feature must have at least one overlapping text label on
the same layer, that provides the terminal name.  Terminals must
resolve to pairs, where each pair is a ``port'', taking the inductance
matrix as an N-port network.  The pair is ordered, with one terminal
being the ``plus'' terminal, the other the ``minus'' terminal.

This is all accomplished by adherence to the following rules.

\begin{enumerate}
\item{The features (boxes or polygons) and labels which equivalence
nodes and define terminals are created on special layers.  The layer
name is the same as the layer name of the conductor which provides the
nodes.  The purpose name is the special keyword ``{\vt fhterm}''. 
Thus for example, for a metal layer named ``{\vt M1}'' (which has the
default ``{\vt drawing}'' purpose) the corresponding special layer has
the full layer-purpose pair (LPP) name ``{\vt M1:fhterm}''.  Such a
LPP should be defined for each conducting layer in the technology
file.}

\item{Terminal features must touch or enclose at least one node. 
Nodes can be found at the center of each edge of each tile.  When
connecting to the end of a metal strip, for example, the entire
transverse width of the strip end should be enclosed in or touch the
terminal feature, so that current flow is uniform.}

\item{Each terminal feature must have at least one overlapping text label
on the same layer giving a terminal name.}

\item{Each terminal is one of a pair, the pair representing a port. 
The terminals of each pair must contact the same conductor group,
i.e., be connected.}

\item{It is possible for a terminal to be used in more than one port,
in which case the terminal will have more than one overlapping label.}

\item{Port-terminal association is by name.  Name labels must follow
these rules:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Terminal names consist of a port name and a suffix.  If the name
string contains punctuation or white space, the first occurrence of
such is stripped, and the port name is taken as the characters to the
left, and the suffix is taken as the characters to the right, of where
the punctuation or white space resided.  If there is no punctuation or
white space, the port name is the name string with the rightmost
character stripped, and the suffix is this character.  The port name
and suffix must each contain at least one printable character or a
fatal error results.  The port name is arbitrary, but must be unique
among the ports.}

\item{Both terminals of a port must have the same port name, case
sensitive.  It is a fatal error if a terminal can not be paired.}

\item{Both terminals of a port must have different suffixes.  The
suffix is used only to order the terminals in the port.  This is done
using lexicographic ordering of the suffix strings.  Beyond ordering,
the suffix is ignored.  It is a fatal error if the suffixes are the
same.}

\item{Both terminals of a port must contact the same conductor group.}
\end{enumerate} }

\item{For each terminal feature, a list of intersecting nodes is
created internally.  The first node in the list is taken as the
reference.  If there are additional nodes, they are equivalenced to
the reference node, using the {\it FastHenry} ``{\vt .equiv}''
construct.}

\item{For each port, a {\it FastHenry} ``{\vt .extern}'' construct is
used to provide the reference nodes of the two terminals in order,
followed by the port name.}
\end{enumerate}

%-----------------------------------
\subsubsection{Technology File Setup}

Setup parallels setup of the three-dimensional layer sequence database
(see \ref{ldb3d}), which in turn follows setup of the extraction
system (see \ref{extsetup}).  These sections should be consulted for
detailed setup information, here we provide some supplemental
information.

To the interface, there are two different materials:
\begin{description}
\item{conductors}\\
Conductors will have one of the following:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Any of the {\vt Conductor}, {\vt Routing}, {\vt GroundPlane},
{\vt GroundPlaneClear}, or {\vt Contact} technology file keywords (or
their aliases) applied.  All of these implicitly give the {\et
Conductor} keyword.}

\item{Any of the {\et Rsh}, {\et Rho}, {\et Sigma}, or {\et Lambda}
keywords applied with a positive value.}
\end{enumerate}

\item{insulators}\\
Insulators will have one of the {\et Dielectric} or {\et Via} keywords
applied, and also the {\et EpsRel} keyword applied with a value of 1.0
or larger.
\end{description}

In addition, layers that are to be used in the interface as conductors
or insulators must have all of the following:

\begin{itemize}
\item{A {\et Thickness} keyword applied with a value greater than
zero.}

\item{Must be visible in the layer table.}

\item{Must not have the {\et Symbolic} keyword applied.}
\end{itemize}

Conductor layers can have the following optional keywords defined. 
These control the filamentation of conductor layers carrying current
in the plane of the substrate, in the direction normal to the
substrate.  This accounts for penetration or skin depth in planar
areas of material, in the Z direction.  Typically, for superconductors
at least, lateral dimensions are much larger than film thicknesses, so
the volume element refinement tends to keep the film thinkness
unbroken in the Z direction.  For accurate account of the penetration
depth, this should be further subdivided, and filamentation is one way
to accomplish this.

\begin{itemize}
\item{A {\et FH\_nhinc} keyword with an integer value greater than one
can be applied.  This is the number of filaments into which the
segment will be divided, along the normal to the substrate.  See the
{\it FastHenry} documentation for more information about the {\vt
nhinc} parameter which can be applied to segment definitions.}

\item{A {\et FH\_rh} keyword with a real value different from the
default value of 2.0 can be given.  When the filament count is larger
than 2, filaments have varying height so as to maximize the density at
the film surfaces.  This parameter sets the ratio of heights between
adjacent filaments.  A value of 1.0 means that all filaments have the
same height.  See the {\it FastHenry} documentation for more
discussion and information about the {\vt rh} parameter.}
\end{itemize}

The conductor layers can be given a resistivity or conductivity with
the {\et Rho} and {\et Sigma} keywords, respectively.  Additionally,
the {\et Lambda} parameter, which specifies the London penetration
depth for superconductors, can be specified.  This is for the
convenience of {\Xic} users in the superconducting electronics R\&D
community.  In this case, {\et Rho}/{\et Sigma} specify the unpaired
conductivity from the two-fluid model.

The {\et Dielectric} technology file keyword was added to support
capacitance extraction.  This is intended to model an explicit
capacitor dielectric, and differs from {\et Via} layers in the
following ways.

\begin{itemize}
\item{Unlike {\et Via}, it is not assumed to be dark field (but {\et
DarkField} can be applied to the layer explicitly).}

\item{Only one {\et Dielectric} keyword can appear per layer (multiple
{\et Via} keywords are allowed).}

\item{Stacking order is as shown in the layer table ({\et Via} layers
are allowed to appear out of order).}

\item{{\et Dielectric} layers are not planarizing by default, {\et
Via} layers are.}
\end{itemize}

The present interface can take layers in any order.  This is in
contrast with the original interface, that required layers to
alternate conductor/insulator starting with a conductor, and ordering
was obtained entirely from {\et Via} references and not the layer
table order.

After all possible layers from the layer table are sequenced, layers
that are not used in the extracted geometry are discarded.  Note that
dark-field layers are inverted, as we are interested in representing
the physical material.  Thus, for example no structure in a {\et Via}
layer (i.e., no vias) in the layout implies the presence of a
continuous film of insulating material, so the layer is actually
present.

The same layer sequencer is used in the {\cb Cross Section} command in
the {\cb View Menu}.  The cross section display and the interface will
always agree on the ordering and planarization of the layers.  This
was not true with the original interface.

In addition to the layers that describe material geometry, the
interface can make use of a masking layer.  This allows only certain
specified parts of the current cell to be evaluated.  When present,
geometry is clipped to objects on this layer before being processed in
the interface.

By default, a layer named {\vt FHRY} with purpose {\vt drawing} is
assumed for the masking layer.  Such a layer should be defined in the
technology file.  It should be given a GDSII mapping to allow saving
of work containing the layer to GDSII or OASIS files.  As an
alternative, the {\et FhLayerName} variable can be set to the name of
another layer, which will instead provide the masking function.

Finally, the layers used in terminal definitions should be configured
into the technology file.  Generally, there is an {\Xic} layer
corresponding to each conducting layer, with a purpose name ``{\vt
fhterm}'' and the same base layer name.  In order to save the layout
with terminals as GDSII or OASIS, a GDSII layer mapping should be
applied for these layers.

%-----------------------------------
\subsubsection{Output File}

The output file is a {\it FastHenry} input file, with format as
documented in the original {\it FastHenry} manual, potentially with
the extensions for superconductivity support ({\vt lambda}
specifications) if the {\et Lambda} parameter is given to any layer
used (making it a superconductor).  Such constructs are {\bf not}
compatible with the original MIT {\it FastHenry}, but require the
Whiteley Research version, or a derivative.

At the top of the file is a comment containing the layer sequence. 
For example:

\begin{verbatim}
* Layers           Plane        Thickness    EpsRel
* Substrate                     75.000       11.900
* Insulator CO     0.000        0.190        4.200
* Insulator VIA1   0.190        0.095        2.900
* Insulator VIA2   0.285        0.095        2.900
* Insulator VIA3   0.380        0.095        2.900
* Conductor M4     0.475        0.220
* Insulator VIA4   0.695        0.095        2.900
* Conductor M5     0.790        0.220
* Insulator VIA5   1.010        0.095        2.900
* Conductor M6     1.105        0.220
* Insulator VIA6   1.325        0.095        2.900
* Insulator VIA7   1.420        0.610        4.200
* Insulator VIA8   2.030        0.610        4.200
\end{verbatim}

The {\vt Plane} is the base elevation of the mask objects of a
planarizing layer, that is, the top surface of the layer minus the
layer thickness value.  This field will be empty for non-planarizing
layers.

%-----------------------------------
\subsubsection{Tips and Hints}

\begin{itemize}
\item{It is easy to generate input files that take an excessively
long time to run.  This is probably the most common pitfall.  The
run time increases with increasing segment count.  The segment  
count is approximately proportional to the number of lines in the
input file.}

\item{Non-Manhattan features can be very bad news.  These are
``Manhattanized'' by converting non-Manhattan edges into stepwise
approximations.  The large number of edges that can be produced by
this may lead te excessive run time.  The {\cb FhManhGridCnt} entry in
the {\cb Params} page of the control panel can be decreased to reduce
the number of segments.}

\item{Too-few segments is also to be avoided, as the calculation may
not be suitably accurate.  The {\cb Volume Element Refinement} check
box in the {\cb Params} page should always be checked.  The entered
number can be varied, the user should experiment.  Larger values
should provide better accuracy at the expense of longer computation
time.}

\item{One should not try to extract ``too much'', due to the FastHenry
limitations.  How much is too much depends on a lot a factors, the
user should experiment to gain a feel for their process and computer
hardware.}

    <h2>The Run Page</h2>

    The <b>Run</b> page contains controls for running the
    supported programs, or creating input files for these
    programs.  This is the default page, shown when the panel
    appears.

    <p>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>Run in foreground</b><dd>
    At the top of the page is the <b>Run in foreground</b>
    check box.  When checked, the program will run
    synchronously in the foreground, rather than
    asynchronously in the background.  Aside from possibly
    being helpful when debugging problems, it is not clear
    that this mode has any value.

    <dt><b>Use FastHenry Internal NHINC, RH</b><dd>
    If set, the <tt>nhinc</tt> and <tt>rh</tt> values are
    passed to <i>FastHenry</i>, which will use the values
    internally for filament generation.  If not set, the
    values will be used in the input file generation to refine
    segments according to the same parameters, and
    <i>FastHenry</i> will not create additional filaments. 
    This button tracks the state of the <a
    href="FhUseFilament"><b>FhUseFilament</b></a> variable
    (set or not).
    </dl>

    <p>
    The <b>FastHenry Volume Element Refinement</b> allows one
    to crudely refine the raw segmentation.  By default, this
    is not enabled, so that only tiling provides refinement. 
    This may be a good starting point for a third-party
    refinement algorithm, but with present <i>FastHenry</i>
    programs is unlikely to provide accurate results as-is. 
    When enabled, the crude refinement should provide somewhat
    better results.

    <p>
    The refinement algorithm works as follows.  For each
    conductor, find the volume and divide by the film
    thickness.  The maximum size is taken as the square root
    of the sum of these terms divided by the <a
    href="FhVolElTarget"><b>FhVolElTarget</b></a> as entered. 
    If a side of a tile exceeds this length, it is subdivided. 
    This is repeated until no tiles have sides larger than the
    calculated length.  The total number of tiles (or "volume
    elements") is approximately the target value entgered. 
    The total number of segments is approximately six times
    larger.

    <p>
    Additionally, a minimum dimension can be defined.  Volume
    elements with a dimension smaller than the minimum will be
    ignored.

    <p>
    The refinement is "crude" due to each refined volume
    element being approximately the same size.  If the size is
    small enough, sufficient spatial resolution for accurate
    calculation is achieved.  This resolution is needed along
    edges, and at corners, where there are strong field
    gradients, but is gross overkill for most areas.  Since
    the solving time is related to the total number of
    segments, this type of refinement is very inefficient with
    respect to memory use and execution speed.

    <dl>
    <dt><b>Enable</b><dd>
    This check box will enable or disable the refinement. 
    When pressed, the two numerical entry areas will become
    un-grayed, and internally the <a

    <b>FhVolElTarget</b> entry area, and the <a
    href="FhVolElMin"><b>FfVolElMin</b></a> variable will be
    set to the number shown in the <b>FhVolElMin</b> entry
    area.  When the <b>Enable</b> button is set inactive, the
    <b>FhVolElTarget</b> and <b>FhVolElMin</b> variables are
    unset.  The <a href="FhVolEnable"><b>FhVolEnable</b></a>

    <h2>The Jobs Page</h2>

    <p>
    <img src="screenshots/lrex3.png" align=right>
    The <b>Jobs</b> page contains a list of running background jobs.
    Each entry provides the process identification number (PID), the
    name of the executing program, and the local date and time when
    started.  Entries can be selected by clicking with the mouse.

    <p>
    When an entry is selected, the <b>Abort job</b> button below the
    list becomes un-grayed.  Clicking this button will terminate the
    selected process.  The user should consider that there is no
    confirmation and no ability to resume the run.
!!LATEX fhpanel extract.tex
This panel, brought up by the {\cb Extract LR} button in the {\cb
Extract Menu}, controls the interface to external
inductance/resistance extraction programs described therein.  The
interface can also be controlled to a large extent with the {\cb !fh}
prompt line command.

The panel functionality is divided into three pages, selectable
through the tabs along the top of the window.  Common to all pages is
a {\cb Help} button, status line, and {\cb Dismiss} button.  The
status line indicates the number of background extraction jobs
currently running.

%-----------------------------------
\subsubsection{The Run Page}

The {\cb Run} page contains controls for running the supported
programs, or creating input files for these programs.  This is the
default page, shown when the panel appears.

\begin{description}
\item{\cb Run in foreground}\\
At the top of the page is the {\cb Run in foreground} check box.  When
checked, the program will run synchronously in the foreground, rather
than asynchronously in the background.  Aside from possibly being
helpful when debugging problems, it is not clear that this mode has
any value.

This check box sets, and is set by, the {\et FhForeg} variable.

\item{\cb Out to console}\\
When the {\cb Out to console} check box is checked, the program output
will be printed in the console window, i.e., the shell window from
which {\Xic} is running.  It may be useful to verify that all is well
by watching this output.

This check box sets, and is set by, the {\et FhMonitor} variable.

\item{\cb Run File}\\
This button and adjacent text entry allows a compatible input file
to be run by the inductance/resistance extraction program
currently configured.  The text area should contain a path to a
valid input file for the configured program.  The program will
run, and results will appear, as for a normal extraction run.

\item{\cb Run Extraction}\\
This button will dump a temporary input file, run the program, and
display the results.  The result file is named {\it cellname\/}{\vt
-}{\it pid\/}{\vt .fh\_log}, where {\it cellname} is the name of the
current cell, and {\it pid} is the process id of the spawned process
used to run the program.  The file contains listings of the input file
produced by the interface and the output file produced by the program.

By default, the program is run in the background.  The label at the
bottom of the panel will indicate that the job is running.  When
complete, a {\cb File Browser} window containing the result file will
appear.  While jobs are running in the background, one can continue
using {\Xic}.

If the {\et FhForeg} variable is set, from the {\cb Run in foreground}
check box or with the {\cb !set} command, then the program will
instead run in the foreground.  In this case, the result file is named
{\it cellname\/}{\vt .fh\_log}, and {\Xic} will be unresponsive until
the run completes.

\item{\cb Dump FastHenry File}\\
This button allows an input file to be generated, which is in a format
compatible with the {\it FastHenry} program.  The default name for
this file is {\it cellname\/}{\vt .inp}, where {\it cellname} is the
current cell name.

\item{\cb FhArgs}\\
This text entry area can be given a string, which will be included in
the argument list when the program is run with the {\cb Run
Extraction} button.  This allows specialized command line options to
be provided during the run, which the user may require.  This entry
field is tied to the {\et FhArgs} variable.

\item{FhDefaults}
This text entry allows the user to provide a string which will appear
in a {\vt .DEFAULT} line in the created {\it FastHenry} input file. 
See the FastHenry documentation for syntax and options.  This entry
field is tied to the {\et FhDefaults} variable.

\item{\cb FhFreq}\\
This consists of three entry areas, which take the starting and ending
evaluation frequencies for {\it FastHenry} runs, and the number of
intermediate frequencies to evaluate.  This corresponds to the {\vt
.Freq} specification line in {\it FastHenry} input files.  The
frequencies are given in hertz.  If the third field in empty, then
evaluation is at the specified frequencies only.  This variable is
tied to the {\et FhFreq} variable, which can also be set with the {\cb
!set} command.

\item{\cb Path to FastHenry}\\
Near the bottom of the page is an entry area where the path to the
{\it FastHenry} executable program can be edited.  This entry area
displays and sets the {\et FhPath} variable.
\end{description}

%-----------------------------------
\subsubsection{The Params page}

This page provides entry areas for parameters used by the
interface.

\begin{description}
\item{\cb FhUnits}\\
This is an option menu which is used to set the length units used in
files produced by the interface.  Choices are meters, centimeters,
millimeters, microns (the default), inches, and mils.  The selection,
if not the default, will set the {\et FhUnits} variable.  Similarly,
setting the variable with the {\cb !set} command will update the state
of the menu.  The choice currently in effect will be applied when
input files are generated.  The choice of units will not affect the
computed inductance/resistance.

\index{FhManhGridCnt variable}
\item{\cb FhManhGridCnt}\\
{\bf Value:} real number 1e2--1e5.\\
When a non-Manhattan polygon is ``Manhattanized'' for {\it FastHenry},
it is converted to an approximating Manhattan polygon.  The value in
this entry is used to set the minimum rectangle width and height
allowed in the decomposition.  It sets, and is set by, the {\et
FhManhGridCnt} variable.  The minimum size is given by
\begin{quote}
{\vt sqrt(}{\it area\_of\_interest\/}{\vt /FhManhGridCnt)}
\end{quote}
The default entry value is 1000.  Larger values are more accurate
but slow processing, sometimes dramatically.  The {\it
area\_of\_interest} is the layout area being processed for input to
{\it FastHenry}.

\index{FhDefaults variable}
\item{\cb FhDefaults}\\
Any text entered into this area will be included in a {\vt
.defaults} line in {\it FastHenry} input.  The text must be
understood by the {\it FastHenry} program in use.  The text
will also be saved in and track the {\et FhDefaults} variable.

\index{FhDefNhinc variable}
\item{\cb FhDefNhinc}\\
This entry tracks the value of the {\et FhDefNhinc} variable,
which sets a default value for the {\it FastHenry} {\vt nhinc}
parameter.  This will be overridden by values set by the layer
keyword {\vt FH\_nhinc} in the technology file, unless the
{\et FhOverride} variable is set, in which case the variable
has precedence.

\index{FhDefRh variable}
\item{\cb FhDefRh}\\
This entry tracks the value of the {\et FhDefRh} variable,
which sets a default value for the {\it FastHenry} {\vt rh}
parameter.  This will be overridden by values set by the layer
keyword {\vt FH\_rh} in the technology file, unless the {\et
FhOverride} variable is set, in which case the variable has
precedence.

\index{FhOverride variable}
\item{\cb Override Layer NHINC, RH}\\
When this check box is set, the values of the {\cb FhDefNhinc}
and {\cb FhDefRh} entries override values set with technology
file keywords on individual layers.  This tracks the state of
the {\et FhOverride} variable (set or not).

\index{FhUseFilament variable}
\item{\cb Use FastHenry Internal NHINC, RH}\\
If set, the {\vt >nhinc} and {\vt rh} values are passed to
{\it FastHenry\/}, which will use the values internally for
filament generation.  If not set, the values will be used in
the input file generation to refine segments according to the
same parameters, and {\it FastHenry} will not create
additional filaments.  This button tracks the state of the
{\et FhUseFilament} variable (set or not).

\end{description}

The {\cb FastHenry Volume Element Refinement} allows one to
crudely refine the raw segmentation.  By default, this is not
enabled, so that only tiling provides refinement.  This may be
a good starting point for a third-party refinement algorithm,
but with present {\it FastHenry} programs is unlikely to
provide accurate results as-is.  When enabled, the crude
refinement should provide somewhat better results.

The refinement algorithm works as follows.  For each
conductor, find the volume and divide by the film thickness. 
The maximum size is taken as the square root of the sum of
these terms divided by the {\et FhVolElTarget} as entered.  If
a side of a tile exceeds this length, it is subdivided.  This
is repeated until no tiles have sides larger than the
calculated length.  The total number of tiles (or ``volume
elements'') is approximately the target value entgered.  The
total number of segments is approximately six times larger.

Additionally, a minimum dimension can be defined.  Volume
elements with a dimension smaller than the minimum will be
ignored.

The refinement is ``crude'' due to each refined volume element
being approximately the same size.  If the size is small
enough, sufficient spatial resolution for accurate calculation
is achieved.  This resolution is needed along edges, and at
corners, where there are strong field gradients, but is gross
overkill for most areas.  Since the solving time is related to
the total number of segments, this type of refinement is very
inefficient with respect to memory use and execution speed.

\begin{description}
\item{\cb Enable}\\
This check box will enable or disable the refinement.  When
pressed, the two numerical entry areas will become un-grayed,
and internally the {\et FhVolElTarget} variable will be set to
the number shown in the {\cb FhVolElTarget} entry area, and
the {\et FfVolElMin} variable will be set to the number shown
in the {\cb FhVolElMin} entry area.  When the {\cb Enable}
button is set inactive, the {\et FhVolElTarget} and {\cb
FhVolElMin} variables are unset.  The {\et FhVolEnable}
variable tracks the state (set or unset) of the {\cb Enable}
button.

\item{\cb FhVolElTarget}\\
This entry area is sensitive only when the {\cb Enable} check
box is checked.  It tracks the value of the {\et
FhVolElTarget} variable, which can be set to a real value of
1e2 -- 1e5.  This will be the approximate number of refined
tiles generated in the input file.

\item{\cb FhVolElMin}\\
This entry area is sensitive only when the {\cb Enable} check
box is checked.  It tracks the value of the {\et FhVolElMin}
variable, which can be set to a real value of 0 -- 1.0. 
Volume elements with a dimension smaller that this fraction of
the maximum dimension computed for the volume element target
will be ignored.
\end{description}

%-----------------------------------
\subsubsection{The Jobs page}

The {\cb Jobs} page contains a list of running background jobs.  Each
entry provides the process identification number (PID), the name of
the executing program, and the local date and time when started. 
Entries can be selected by clicking with the mouse.

When an entry is selected, the {\cb Abort job} button below the list
becomes un-grayed.  Clicking this button will terminate the selected
process.  The user should consider that there is no confirmation and
no ability to resume the run.
