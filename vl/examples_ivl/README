This directory contains the Verilog source files from the test suite for
ivl (source file: ivl_tests-20010630.tgz).  Ivl is another Verilog simulator
project, see http://icarus.com.  The test suite is available from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/ivtest

The ivltests directory contains tons of useful test files.  A very few
have been modified (use "grep SRW *.v") to fix possible bugs and/or
add comments.  The run script will run these tests.  The run.out file
contains sample output from the run script. NOTE: both stdout and stderr
are directed into run.out.

The contrib directory contains a few more verilog files.  The add32.v
file seems to have fundamental errors and won't run under vl.
