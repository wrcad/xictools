vl-4.3.3  12/23/19

New internal vl_simulator::setptime,  vl_simulator::step no longer takes
an argument but increments steptime instead.

New vl_var_factory for vl_var.

vl-1.6 11/8/14

Misc. tweaks for portability to ever-changing Linux distributions. 
In particular, vl now build on openSuse 13.1.

vl-1.5 1/11/09

Misc. tweaks to avoid compiler warnings with newer (e.g., gcc-4.2.1)
compilers.  Fix symbol name clash in yacc file.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
vl-1.4 3/3/08

Fixed some compiler issues that prevented successful builds with recent
gcc releases, affects at least Cygwin and Mingw.
1) Added explicit 'this' pointers in template methods in vl_list.h.
2) Added '#include <unistd.h>' in verilog.l.
3) Fixed a number of deprecated const/non-const string assignments to
   silence compiler warnings.
4) Changes to avoid reusing previously defined symbol names to silence
   compiler warnings.
5) Changes to support embedding in WRspice program.
6) Other misc. fixes to avoid compiler warnings.

Otherwise, no changes to program logic or capability.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
vl-1.3  4/28/03

Updated the program files to conform to the requirements of gcc-3.x. 
Previous releases would not build with this compiler, having been
developed using gcc-2.95.3.  Since Red Hat 8.x and later use gcc-3.x,
this lack of compatibility was a problem.

Thank you to the users who sent patches for the update to gcc-3
compatibility, and apologies for the delay in getting this problem
repaired.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
vl-1.2  8/9/02

Updates to the configuration system.

New command line option: -v
If given, the parser will be more verbose in emitting warning messages
about questionable constructs in the input.  This is largely unimplemented
at present.

Previously, if a function was defined with no type or range specifier,
the return type would default to integer, and there would be no
warning or error message.  In the present release, the return type
defaults to register [1:0], and if the -v command line option is
given, a warning message is shown.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
vl-1.1  4/8/02

Fixed syntax in vcd file:  was printing "[a,b]", now correctly prints
"[a:b]".

Intra-assignment delay control (a = #d b) and event controlled
assignments (a = @(...) b) were (incorrectly) non-blocking.

Fixed a used-after-free problem that caused random segmentation
faults.

In case statements, a 'default' clause with no statement body would
crash the program.

Garbage collection for va_var type is now finer grained, reducing
memory use.

Fixed misc. core leaks and other small problems.
