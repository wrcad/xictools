fadder.v	Implement a 1-bit full adder	 Section 14.3.3
		using assign statements.

mux.v		Implement a 2-to-1 multiplexer	 Section 14.3.3
		using assign statement.

for.v		Implement an 8 bit ripple adder	 Section 14.3.3
		using a for loop.

edge_dff.v	Inferring a 1-bit positive	 Section 14.3.3
		edge triggered D-flipflop using
		the always statement.

latch.v		Inferring a 1-bit latch from 	 Section 14.3.3
		the always statement.

function.v	Implement a 4-bit full adder
		using a function "fulladd"

latchmux.v	Illustrates the difference 	 Section 14.6.1
		between a latch inference and
		a mux inference. A slight change
		can make a lot of difference.

multiple.v	Illustrates the effect of 	 Section 14.6.1
		multiple assignments on the same
		variable.
