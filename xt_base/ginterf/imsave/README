The IMSAVE library performs one function only; it provides a simple
method of dumping the contents of a window to a file in various
formats.  Most of IMSAVE came directly from Imlib, and all of the file
formats supported in Imlib are available in IMSAVE.  Unlike Imlib,
IMSAVE compiles and works under Micro$oft Windows (mingw compiler, but
should be portable to more evil compilers with little effort).

To use, simply create an Image class as follows

  Image *im = create_image_from_drawable(window, x, y, w, h);

The window is a GdkWindow or GdkPixmap in Unix/Linux, or an HDC under
that other operating system.  Then assuming im is not nil (which
(guess what) indicates a failure,

  im->save_image(filename, save_info);

will dump a file from the window contents.  As in Imlib, the kind of
file is determined from the extension of the file name:  jpg, ps, png,
etc.  The second argument is usually 0, but otherwise allows some
defaults to be changed.  Finally,

  delete im;

to clean up.  Simple huh?

Further questions can be resolved by reading the source code.  Note
that this is really just a shell around a lot of other stuff: 
libjpeg, libpng, and libtiff in particular.

Version 1.4 New Feature

Previous releases of the library assumed that the various helper
functions (convert from ImageMagick, the netpbm functions, cjpeg and
djpeg) were located in /usr/local/bin.  Now, the programs will be
looked for along a search path.  The search path (a colon-delimited
list of directories) can be provided in the environment variable
IMSAVE_PATH.  If not set, the internal path is
"/usr/local/bin:/usr/X11R6/bin".

Some notes on porting libjpeg, libpng, libtiff to Windows/mingw.  I
have not tested the libraries extensively.  The comments below apply
to simply getting the libraries to build under mingw.

LIBJPEG:
  distribution:
    jpeg-6b  (as jpegsrc-v6b.tar.gz)

  This one is easy, it compiled without modification.

LIBPNG:  This requires yet another library: libz.
  distributions:
    zlib-1.1.3
    libpng-1.0.8
    
  Use script/makefile.std as the makefile, and tweek the defines, such
  as setting CC=gcc.  No changes were required to libz.

LIBTIFF:  This provides some minor challenges.
  distribution:
    tiff-v3.4

  The config.guess script is old, and does not return anything useful
  under mingw.  Fix this by simply copying in the config.guess from
  libjpeg.
  More serious is lack of a getopt() which breaks the compile of
  mkg3states.c.  You will have to recode this to avoid using getopt. 
  Once done, the package compiled successfully.
