    <p>
    <i>WRspice</i> data are in the form of vectors, which are lists of
    numbers that may represent, e.g., time, voltage, or any typed or
    untyped set of values.  Vectors of length one are termed
    "scalars".  During a simulation, each of the circuit variables,
    plus a scale vector, are filled with data from the simulation. 
    For example, in transient analysis, the scale vector (named
    "<tt>time</tt>") will contain the time values where output is
    generated, and each node and other circuit variables will have a
    corresponding vector of the same length as the scale, containing
    the values for the scale points.

    <p>
    For each simulation, the resulting vectors are contained in a
    "plot", which is a container data structure for vectors.  The plot
    is given a name (such as "tran2"), and appended to a list
    containing other previously-generated plots.  If an input file
    contains an <a href=".exec"><tt>.exec</tt></a> block in which
    vectors are created, a special "exec" plot will be created to hold
    these.  There is also an internally generated plot named <a
    href="constants"><tt>constants</tt></a> which contains various
    scalars set to constant values.  The <tt>constants</tt> plot can
    not be deleted, thus the internal plot list is never empty.

    <p>
    When a plot data file is read into <i>WRspice</i> with the <a
    href="load"><b>load</b></a> command, a plot containing vectors is
    produced, as if an analysis had been run.

    <p>
    When a new plot is created by an analysis or with the <b>load</b>
    command, it becomes the "current plot".  The current plot
    represents a context, where the existing vectors can be accessed
    by their name, and new vectors created, for example with the <a
    href="let"><b>let</b></a> command, will (by default) be added to
    the current plot.

    <p>
    The "current plot" is usually the last plot produced by an
    analysis run, or the <tt>constants</tt> plot if no analyses have
    been run or rawfiles loaded.  The current plot can be changed with
    the <a href="setplot"><b>setplot</b></a> command, or with the <a
    href="plotspanel"><b>Plots</b></a> panel from the <b>Tools</b>
    menu.  A vector from the current plot or the <tt>constants</tt>
    plot can be referenced by name.  A vector from any plot can be
    referenced with the notation
    <blockquote>
    <i>plotname</i>.<i>vecname</i>
    </blockquote>
    where <i>plotname</i> is the name of the plot or an alias, and
    <i>vecname</i> is the vector name.

    <p>
    The default separation character is a period, however this can be
    changed by setting the variable <a
    href="plot_catchar"><tt>plot_catchar</tt></a>.  If this variable is
    set to a string consisting of a single punctuation character, that
    character becomes the separator.  We will continue to use a period
    in the examples, but be aware that other options exist.

    <p>
    The <i>plotname</i> can also be a numerical index.  Plots are
    saved in the order created, and as listed by the <b>setplot</b>
    command without arguments, and in the <b>Plots</b> tool.  The
    numerical forms below are equivalent to the Berkeley SPICE3
    syntax.  These cause trouble in <i>WRspice</i>, however, since
    they are often misinterpreted as numbers, and typically require
    double quoting when used as arguments to commands.  <i>WRspice</i>
    has an equivalent set of alias keywords which do not require
    special treatment.

    <p>
    Below is a list of the special alias keywords and constructs which can
    be given as the <i>plotname</i>, in addition to the actual name of the
    plot to reference.  Below, <i>N</i> is an unsigned integer.

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>curplot</tt><dd>
    This is an alias for the name of the current plot.  Use of this
    keyword may seem redundant, but it has an important use to be
    explained below.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt>-<i>N</i><dd>
    Use the <i>N</i>'th plot back from the current plot.  <i>N</i>
    must be 1 or larger.  For example, "<tt>-1.v(1)</tt>" will
    reference <tt>v(1)</tt> in the previous plot.  It is likely that
    this form must be double-quoted to avoid misinterpretation as a
    number.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>prev</tt>[<i>N</i>]<dd>
    This is very similar functionally to the form above, but does not
    cause parse errors.  The square brackets above are <b>not</b>
    literal, but indicate that the integer is optional.  If missing,
    <i>N</i>=1 is implied.  With <i>N</i>=0, the current plot is
    indicated (equivalent to <tt>curplot</tt>).
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt>+<i>N</i><dd>
    This goes in the reverse direction, indicating a plot later in the
    list than the current plot.  It is likely that this form must be
    double-quoted to avoid misinterpretation as a number.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>next</tt>[<i>N</i>]<dd>
    This is very similar functionally to the form above, but does not
    cause parse errors.  The square brackets above are <b>not</b>
    literal, but indicate that the integer is optional.  If missing,
    <i>N</i>=1 is implied.  With <i>N</i>=0, the current plot is
    indicated (equivalent to <tt>curplot</tt>).
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><i>N</i><dd>
    An integer without <tt>+</tt> or <tt>-</tt> indicates an absolute
    index into the plot list, zero-based.  The value 0 will always
    indicate the "constants" plot, which is the first plot created (on
    program startup).  It is likely that this form must be
    double-quoted to avoid misinterpretation as a number.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>plot</tt>[<i>N</i>]<dd>
    This is very similar functionally to the form above, but does not
    cause parse errors.  The square brackets above are <b>not</b>
    literal, but indicate that the integer is optional.  If missing,
    <i>N</i>=0 is implied, which will specify the <tt>constants</tt>
    plot.
    </dl>

    <p>
    When using the <i>plotname</i>.<i>vecname</i> construct,
    internally the vector and its scale are copied into the current
    plot as temporary vectors.  If you do "<tt>plot -1.v(1)</tt>" (for
    example) it may be surprising to find that the plot title, etc. 
    are from the current plot, and not the source plot.

    <p>
    When a script is run, the current plot when the script starts is
    taken as the "context plot" which will be used to resolve
    references to vectors in the script, after searching the current
    plot (if different).  Suppose that we have a script that defines a
    loop counter vector, then runs a loop that performs an analysis. 
    If we didn't save and search the context plot, the loop counter
    vector would not be accessible after the analysis is run, since
    the analysis will set a new current plot.

    <p>
    One should keep this behavior in mind, as it can sometimes cause
    surprises.  For example, consider the script fragment

    <blockquote><tt>
    run<br>
    let foo = i(vds)<br>
    plot foo</tt>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Now suppose that the context plot contains a vector named
    "<tt>foo</tt>".  Instead of creating a new vector in the current
    plot, the "<tt>foo</tt>" vector in the context plot will be used,
    probably meaning that the scale in the displayed plot is
    incorrect.

    <p>
    To enforce the desired behavior, the second line above should be
    changed to
    <blockquote><tt>
    let curplot.foo = i(vds)</tt>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Script authors should be in the habit of using this form when
    creating vectors, when there is any possibility of a name clash
    with the context plot.

    <a name="vecs"></a>
    <h2>Vector Characteristics</h2>

    Vectors posses a dimensionality.  A scalar is a vector of the
    lowest dimensionality.  Most vectors are one-dimensional lists of
    numbers.  Certain types of analysis produce multidimensional
    vectors, which are analogous to arrays.  This dimensionality is
    indicated when the vectors are listed with the <a
    href="display"><b>display</b></a> command or the <a
    href="let"><b>let</b></a> command without arguments.  Plotting a
    multidimensional vector will produce a family of traces.  Elements
    and sub-dimensional vectors are specified with multiple square
    brackets, with the bracket on the right having the lowest
    dimensionality.

    <p>
    For example, one might issue the following command:
    <blockquote>
    <tt>.ac dec 10 1Hz 1Mhz dc v1 0 2 .1 v2 4.5 5.5 .25</tt>
    </blockquote>
    which will perform an ac analysis with the dc sources <tt>v1</tt>
    and <tt>v2</tt> stepped through the ranges 0 - 2 step .1 for
    <tt>v1</tt>, 4.5 - 5.5 step .25 for <tt>v2</tt>.  The resulting
    output vectors will have dimensions [5,21,61], i.e., 5 values for
    <tt>v2</tt>, 21 for <tt>v1</tt>, and 61 for the ac analysis. 
    Typing "<tt>plot v(1)</tt>" (for example) would plot all 21*5
    analyses on the same scale (this would not be too useful). 
    However, one can plot subranges by entering, for example,
    "<tt>plot v(1)[1]</tt>" which would plot the results for
    <tt>v2</tt> = 4.75, or "<tt>plot v(1)[1][2]</tt>" for <tt>v2</tt>
    = 4.75, <tt>v1</tt> = .2, etc.  Range specifications also work,
    for example "<tt>plot v(1)[2][0,2]</tt>" plots the values for
    <tt>v2</tt> = 5, <tt>v1</tt> = 0, .1, .2.  The memory space
    required to hold the multidimensional plot data can grow quite
    large, so one should be reasonable.

    <p>
    Vectors have an indexing that begins with 0, and an index, or
    range of indices, can be specified in square brackets following
    the vector name, for each dimension.  The notation
    [<i>lower</i><tt>,</tt><i>upper</i>], where <i>lower</i> and
    <i>upper</i> are integers, denotes the range of elements between
    <i>lower</i> and <i>upper</i>.  The notation [<i>num</i>] denotes
    the <i>num</i>'th element.  If <i>upper</i> is less than
    <i>lower</i>, the order of the elements is reversed.

    <p>
    Vectors typically have defined units.  The units are carried
    through a computation, and simplified when the result is
    generated.  Presently, the system can not handle fractional
    powers.  The units of a vector can be set with the <a
    href="settype"><b>settype</b></a> command.

    <a name="crtvec"></a>
    <h2>Vector Creation and Assignment</h2>

    <p>
    Using the <a href="let"><b>let</b></a> command, a vector may be
    assigned the values of a vector already defined, or a
    floating-point number (a real scalar), or a comma separated pair
    of numbers (a complex scalar).  A number may be written in any
    format acceptable to SPICE2, such as <tt>14.6Meg</tt> or
    <tt>-1.231e-4</tt>.  Note that one can use either scientific
    notation or one of the abbreviations like MEG or G (case
    insensitive), but not both.  As with SPICE2, a number may have
    trailing alphabetic characters after it, which can indicate the
    units.  If the vector being assigned to does not exist, it will be
    created.

    <p>
    The <a href="compose"><b>compose</b></a> command can also be used
    to create vectors, and is useful for creating vectors with
    multiple points that follow some relationship, such as linear or
    logarithmic.

    <p>
    Newly-created vectors are added to the current plot, unless a
    <i>plotname</i> field is specified as part of the vector reference
    name.  For example, entering
    <blockquote>
    <tt>let constants.myvec = 2</tt>
    </blockquote>
    will assign a vector <tt>myvec</tt> in the <tt>constants</tt> plot
    the value 2.0.  Entering
    <blockquote>
    <tt>let myvec = constants.const_e</tt>
    </blockquote>
    will assign a vector <tt>myvec</tt> in the current plot the values
    of the vector <tt>const_e</tt> in the <tt>constants</tt> plot.  The
    <b>let</b> command without arguments will print a listing of
    vectors in the current plot.

    <p>
    Recent <i>WRspice</i> releases also allow vectors to be assigned a
    value with the <a href="set"><b>set</b></a> command.  The syntax
    in this case is

    <blockquote>
      <tt>set &</tt><i>vector</i> <tt>=</tt> <i>value</i>
    </blockquote>

    which is equivalent to

    <blockquote>
      <tt>let</tt> <i>vector</i> <tt>=</tt> <i>value</i>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    When entering this form from the <i>WRspice</i> command line, the
    '<tt>&</tt>' character must be hidden from the shell, perhaps most
    conveniently be preceding it with a backslash.  The <i>value</i>
    must be numeric, and a value must be given, unlike normal usage of
    the <b>set</b> command which can set a variable as a boolean by
    omitting the right side of the assignment.

    <a name="analvec"></a>
    <h2>Analysis Vectors and Access Mapping</h2>

    The vectors actually produced during analysis depend on
    the type of analysis, but the most common output is the node
    voltage.  Node voltages are denoted by vectors of the form
    <tt>v</tt>(<i>N</i>), where <i>N</i> is a name representing the
    node.  Although the notation looks like a function call, the
    construct actually refers to a vector, and may be used in
    expressions whenever a vector is syntactically expected.  Another
    common form is <i>name</i><tt>#branch</tt>, which represents the
    "branch" current through voltage sources and inductors.  The SPICE
    algorithm adds a term to the matrix for these elements, which
    represents the current flowing through the device.  As there is a
    specific matrix element for the current for these devices, the
    value is available as an output variable.  The <i>name</i> is the
    name of the voltage source or inductor.

    <p>
    For compatibility with SPICE2, several mappings and equivalences
    are provided.  When referencing node voltages, one can reference a
    node by name (e.g.  <tt>v(6)</tt> or <tt>v(input)</tt>).  These
    are string names of the produced vectors.  In addition, one can
    use the SPICE2 form for the argument inside the parentheses of the
    node voltage construct.  This is (<i>node1</i>
    [<tt>,</tt><i>node2</i>]), where if both <i>node1</i> and
    <i>node2</i> are given, the vector represents the voltage
    difference between nodes <i>node1</i> and <i>node2</i>.  For
    example, <tt>v(1,2)</tt> is equivalent to <tt>v(1) - v(2)</tt>. 
    The <tt>v()</tt> construct in the case of two arguments is like a
    function.

    <p>
    Additionally, the construct <tt>i</tt>(<i>name</i>) is internally
    mapped to <i>name</i><tt>#branch</tt>, and the two notations can
    be used interchangeably.  The <i>name</i> is the name of a voltage
    source or inductor.

    <p>
    Additional mappings familiar from SPICE2 are also recognized in
    <i>WRspice</i>.  In addition to <tt>v</tt> and <tt>i</tt>, the
    following are recognized for node voltages.  These are most useful
    for complex vectors as are produced in ac analysis.

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>vm</tt><dd>
    This computes the magnitude, by mapping to the <tt>mag</tt> vector
    function.  The following forms are equivalent:
    <blockquote>
    <tt>vm(a) = mag(v(a))</tt><br>
    <tt>vm(a,b) = mag(v(a) - v(b))</tt>
    </blockquote>
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>vp</tt><dd>
    This computes the phase, by mapping to the <tt>ph</tt> vector
    function.  The following forms are equivalent:
    <blockquote>
    <tt>vp(a) = ph(v(a))</tt><br>
    <tt>vp(a,b) = ph(v(a) - v(b))</tt>
    </blockquote>
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>vr</tt><dd>
    This computes the real part, by mapping to the <tt>re</tt> vector
    function.  The following forms are equivalent:
    <blockquote>
    <tt>vr(a) = re(v(a))</tt><br>
    <tt>vr(a,b) = re(v(a) - v(b))</tt>
    </blockquote>
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>vi</tt><dd>
    This computes the imaginary part, by mapping to the <tt>im</tt> vector
    function.  The following forms are equivalent:
    <blockquote>
    <tt>vi(a) = im(v(a))</tt><br>
    <tt>vi(a,b) = im(v(a) - v(b))</tt>
    </blockquote>
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>vdb</tt><dd>
    This computes the decibel value (20*log10), by mapping to the
    <tt>db</tt> vector function.  The following forms are equivalent:
    <blockquote>
    <tt>vdb(a) = db(v(a))</tt><br>
    <tt>vdb(a,b) = db(v(a) - v(b))</tt>
    </blockquote>
    </dl>

    Similar constructs are available for the current vectors of
    voltage sources and inductors.  In these constructs, the single
    argument is always the name of a "branch" device, either a voltage
    source or inductor.

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>img</tt><dd>
    This computes the magnitude, by mapping to the <tt>mag</tt> vector
    function.  The following forms are equivalent:
    <blockquote>
    <tt>img(vx) = mag(vx#branch)</tt>
    </blockquote>
    Note that this name differs from the SPICE2 <tt>"im"</tt> to avoid
    a clash with the <tt>im()</tt> vector function in <i>WRspice</i>.
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>ip</tt><dd>
    This computes the phase, by mapping to the <tt>ph</tt> vector
    function.  The following forms are equivalent:
    <blockquote>
    <tt>ip(vx) = ph(vx#branch)</tt>
    </blockquote>
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>ir</tt><dd>
    This computes the real part, by mapping to the <tt>re</tt> vector
    function.  The following forms are equivalent:
    <blockquote>
    <tt>ir(vx) = re(vx#branch)</tt>
    </blockquote>
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>ii</tt><dd>
    This computes the imaginary part, by mapping to the <tt>im</tt> vector
    function.  The following forms are equivalent:
    <blockquote>
    <tt>ii(vx) = im(vx#branch)</tt>
    </blockquote>
    </dl>

    <dl>
    <dt><tt>idb</tt><dd>
    This computes the decibel value (20*log10), by mapping to the
    <tt>db</tt> vector function.  The following forms are equivalent:
    <blockquote>
    <tt>vdb(vx) = db(vx#branch)</tt>
    </blockquote>
    </dl>

    <p>
    There is one additional mapping available,
    <tt>p(</tt><i>devname</i><tt>)</tt>, which returns the
    instantaneous power of a device <i>devname</i>.  This can be
    applied to any device that has a readable "<tt>p</tt>" parameter
    defined, which is true for most devices.  The <a
    href="show"><b>show</b></a> command can be used to list available
    device parameters.  This is particularly useful for sources, as it
    returns the power supplied to the circuit.  For non-dissipative
    elements, it represents the stored power.

    <p>
    This is a mapping to the special vector
    <tt>@</tt><i>devname</i><tt>[p]</tt> (see below).  Thus, the
    special vector data must be available for this form to be used
    successfully, meaning that in analysis, as with other special
    vectors representing device parameters, the vector must be
    explicitly saved with the <a href="save"><b>save</b></a> command
    or in a <a href=".save"><tt>.save</tt></a> line.  However, if this
    form is used in a <a href=".measure"><tt>.measure</tt></a> line,
    the needed vector will be saved automatically.  This is also true
    if the form is used in one of the "runops" as listed with the <a
    href="status"><b>status</b></a> command.

    <a name="special"></a>
    <h2>Special Vectors</h2>

    Most simply, vector names can be any alphanumeric word that starts
    with an alpha character.  Vector names may also be of the form
    <i>string</i>(<i>something</i>), if the <i>string</i> is not the
    name of a built-in or user-defined function.

    <a name="temper"></a>
    <p>
    There is one vector named "<tt>temper</tt>" that is always
    available, though not saved in any plot.  This is the current
    temperature assumed by the program, in Celsius.

    <p>
    In <i>WRspice</i>, a vector name beginning with the '<tt>@</tt>'
    symbol is a "special" vector, and is considered to be a reference
    to an internal device or model parameter, or a circuit parameter. 
    If the variable <a href="spec_catchar"><tt>spec_catchar</tt></a>
    is set to a string consisting of a single punctuation character,
    then that character will identify a special vector, instead of
    '<tt>@</tt>'.  The descriptions below use '<tt>@</tt>', but in
    actuality this character can be respecified by the user.

    <p>
    If the vector name is of the form
    <tt>@</tt><i>name</i>[<i>param</i>], this denotes the parameter
    <i>param</i> of the device or model named <i>name</i>.  Of course,
    there must be a device or model with that name defined for the
    current circuit and <i>param</i> must be a valid parameter name
    for that device or model type.  See the documentation or use the
    <a href="show"><b>show</b></a> command for a listing of the
    parameters available.

    <p>
    Special vectors should be saved with the <a
    href="save"><b>save</b></a> command or on a <a
    href=".save"><tt>.save</tt></a> line during analysis if a value is
    required at each analysis point.  Otherwise, only the current
    value is available, which is the value used at the final analysis
    point after analysis completes.

    <p>
    The special vectors that correspond to device and model parameters
    in the current circuit can be assigned.  When a special vector is
    assigned, the effect is similar to the <a
    href="alter"><b>alter</b></a> command.  Actual assignment is
    deferred until the next analysis run of the current circuit, and
    assignment applies to that run only.  The assignment must be
    repeated if needed for additional runs.

    <p>
    Other special vectors are read-only.

    <p>
    If the vector name is of the form <tt>@</tt><i>param</i>, this
    refers to a parameter of the circuit with the name <i>param</i>. 

    <p>
    These are resolved in the following way.  First, a match to one of
    the "official" options is sought.  These are the options listed in
    the table in the <a href="options">options</a> description.  Any
    of these will match, with the exceptions in the sub-tables listing
    batch mode and obsolete options.

    <p>
    If this fails, parameters defined in the current circuit are
    searched for a matching name.  These are defined in <a
    href=".param"><tt>.param</tt></a> lines.

{\WRspice} data are in the form of vectors, which are lists of numbers
that may represent, e.g., time, voltage, or any typed or untyped set
of values.  Vectors of length one are termed ``scalars''.  During a
simulation, each of the circuit variables, plus a scale vector, are
filled with data from the simulation.  For example, in transient
analysis, the scale vector (named ``{\vt time}'') will contain the
time values where output is generated, and each node and other circuit
variables will have a corresponding vector of the same length as the
scale, containing the values for the scale points.

\index{exec plot}
For each simulation, the resulting vectors are contained in a
``plot'', which is a container data structure for vectors.  The plot
is given a name (such as ``tran2''), and appended to a list containing
other previously-generated plots.  If an input file contains an {\vt
.exec} block in which vectors are created, a special ``exec'' plot
will be created to hold these.  There is also an internally generated
plot named ``{\vt constants}'' which contains various scalars set to
constant values.  The {\vt constants} plot can not be deleted, thus
the internal plot list is never empty.

When a plot data file is read into {\WRspice} with the {\cb load}
command, a plot containing vectors is produced, as if an anaylsis had
been run.  The new plot becomes the current plot.

\index{current plot}
When a new plot is created by an analysis or with the {\cb load}
command, it becomes the ``current plot''.  The current plot represents
a context, where the existing vectors can be accessed by their name,
and new vectors created, for example with the {\cb let} command, will
(by default) be added to the current plot.

The current plot is usually the last plot produced by an analysis run,
or the {\vt constants} plot if no analyses have been run or rawfiles
loaded.  The current plot can be changed with the {\cb setplot}
command, or with the {\cb Plots} panel from the {\cb Tools} menu.  A
vector from the current plot or the {\vt constants} plot can be
referenced by name.  A vector from any plot can be referenced with the
notation
\begin{quote}
{\it plotname\/}.{\it vecname}
\end{quote}
where {\it plotname} is the name of the plot or an alias, and {\it
vecname} is the vector name.

The default separation character is a period, however this can be
changed by setting the variable {\et plot\_catchar}.  If this variable
is set to a string consisting of a single punctuation character, that
character becomes the separator.  We will continue to use a period in
the examples, but be aware that other options exist.

The {\it plotname} can also be a numerical index.  Plots are saved in
the order created, and as listed by the {\cb setplot} command without
arguments, and in the {\cb Plots} tool.  The numerical forms below are
equivalent to the Berkeley SPICE3 syntax.  These cause trouble in
{\WRspice}, however, since they are often misinterpreted as numbers,
and typically require double quoting when used as arguments to
commands.  {\WRspice} has an equivalent set of alias keywords which do
not require special treatment. 

Below is a list of the special alias keywords and constructs which can
be given as the {\it plotname}, in addition to the actual name of the
plot to reference.  Below, {\it N} is an unsigned integer.

\begin{description}
\item{\vt curplot}\\
This is an alias for the name of the current plot.  Use of this
keyword may seem redundant, but it has an important use to be
explained below.

\item{\vt -}{\it N}\\
Use the {\it N\/}'th plot back from the current plot.  {\it N} must be
1 or larger.  For example, ``{\vt -1.v(1)}'' will reference {\vt v(1)}
in the previous plot.  It is likely that this form must be
double-quoted to avoid misinterpretation as a number.

\item{\vt prev}[{\it N\/}]\\
This is very similar functionally to the form above, but does not
cause parse errors.  The square brackets above are {\bf not} literal,
but indicate that the integer is optional.  If missing, {\it N\/}=1 is
implied.  With {\it N\/}=0, the current plot is indicated (equivalent
to {\vt curplot}).

\item{\vt +}{\it N}\\
This goes in the reverse direction, indicating a plot later in the
list than the current plot.  It is likely that this form must be
double-quoted to avoid misinterpretation as a number.

\item{\vt next}[{\it N\/}]\\
This is very similar functionally to the form above, but does not
cause parse errors.  The square brackets above are {\bf not} literal,
but indicate that the integer is optional.  If missing, {\it N\/}=1 is
implied.  With {\it N\/}=0, the current plot is indicated (equivalent
to {\vt curplot}).

\item{\it N}\\
An integer without {\vt +} or {\vt -} indicates an absolute index into
the plot list, zero-based.  The value 0 will always indicate the
``constants'' plot, which is the first plot created (on program
startup).  It is likely that this form must be double-quoted to avoid
misinterpretation as a number.

\item{\vt plot}[{\it N\/}]\\
This is very similar functionally to the form above, but does not
cause parse errors.  The square brackets above are {\bf not} literal,
but indicate that the integer is optional.  If missing, {\it N\/}=0 is
implied, which will specify the {\vt constants} plot.
\end{description}

When using the {\it plotname\/}.{\it vecname} construct, internally
the vector and its scale are copied into the current plot as temporary
vectors.  If you do ``{\vt plot -1.v(1)}'' (for example) it may be
surprising to find that the plot title, etc.  are from the current
plot, and not the source plot.

When a script is run, the current plot when the script starts is taken
as the ``context plot'' which will be used to resolve references to
vectors in the script, after searching the current plot (if
different).  Suppose that we have a script that defines a loop counter
vector, then runs a loop that performs an analysis.  If we didn't save
and search the context plot, the loop counter vector would not be
accessible after the analysis is run, since the analysis will set a
new current plot.

One should keep this behavior in mind, as it can sometimes cause
surprises.  For example, consider the script fragment

\begin{quote} \vt
run\\
let foo = i(vds)\\
plot foo
\end{quote}

Now suppose that the context plot contains a vector named ``{\vt
foo}''.  Instead of creating a new vector in the current plot, the
``{\vt foo}'' vector in the context plot will be used, probably
meaning that the scale in the displayed plot is incorrect.

To enforce the desired behavior, the second line above should be
changed to
\begin{quote} \vt
let curplot.foo = i(vds)
\end{quote}

Script authors should be in the habit of using this form when creating
vectors, when there is any possibility of a name clash with the
context plot.

    </tt></blockquote>

    <p>
    One should note that there are two math subsystems in
    <i>WRspice</i>, the vector system described here, and a <a
    href="devexpr">second system</a> for processing equations found in
    device descriptions during simulation.  Although the expressions
    are syntactically similar, there are important differences that
    must be taken into account, and one should refer to the
    appropriate documentation for the type of expression.

    <p>
    Vector expressions can contain calls to the built-in <a
    href="tranfuncs">tran functions</a> ordinarily used in
    voltage/current source specifications in transient analysis. 
    These functions are the <tt>pulse</tt>, <tt>pwl</tt>, etc,.  If
    assigned to a vector, the vector will have a length equal to the
    current scale (e.g., the time values of the last transient
    analysis plot), and be filled in with values just as if the
    analysis was run with the given source specification.  For example
    <blockquote>
        (run tran .1n 10n)<br>
        <tt>let a = pulse(0 1 1n 1n)</tt>
    </blockquote>
    Vector <tt>a</tt> will have length 101 and contain the pulse values.

    <p>
    There are three such functions, <tt>sin</tt>, <tt>exp</tt>, and
    <tt>gauss</tt>, that have the same names as math functions.  The
    math functions always return data of the same length as the
    argument(s), and take 1 arg for <tt>sin</tt>, <tt>exp</tt> and 2
    for <tt>gauss</tt>.  When one of these names is encountered in an
    expression, <i>WRspice</i> counts the arguments.  If the number of
    arguments is 1 for <tt>sin</tt>/<tt>exp</tt> or 1 or 2 for
    <tt>gauss</tt>, the math function is called, otherwise the tran
    function is called.  It may be necessary to give the
    <tt>gauss</tt> function a phony additional argument to force
    calling the tran function.
 
    <p>
    Vectors can be evaluated by the <a href="variablesub">shell
    parser</a> by adding the prefix <tt>$&</tt> to the vector's name. 
    This is useful, for example, when the value of a vector needs to
    be passed to the shell's <a href="echo">echo</a> command, or in
    circuit description files where vectors are to be evaluated by the
    shell as the file is read.  Similar to the shell constructs,
    <tt>$?&</tt><i>word</i> expands to 1 if <i>word</i> is a defined
    vector, 0 otherwise.  Also <tt>$#&</tt><i>word</i> expands to the
    length of <i>word</i> if <i>word</i> is a defined vector, or 0 if
    not found.  Additionally, the notation
    <tt>$&</tt>(<i>expression</i>) is replaced by the value of the
    vector expression.  A range specification can be added, for
    example <tt>echo $&(a+1)[2]</tt> prints the third entry in
    <tt>a+1</tt>, or 0 if out of range.  If white space exists in the
    <tt>$&(...)</tt> construct, it probably should be quoted. 
    Finally, the shell recognizes the construct
    <tt>$&v($</tt><i>something</i><tt>)</tt> as a reference to a SPICE
    node voltage, so that one can index node voltages as <tt>echo
    $&v($&i)</tt>, for example.  A range specification can be added,
    which can contain shell variables.  This is true for both vectors
    (<tt>$&</tt> prefix) and variables.

    <p>
    There is a special case when <tt>$&</tt> is used with a <a
    href="specialvec">special vector</a> that is referencing a
    string-type parameter.  Since one can have
    <blockquote>
    <tt>.param foo="hello there"</tt>
    </blockquote>
    <tt>$&@foo</tt> will expand to "<tt>hello there</tt>" in this
    case.  Other references to <tt>@foo</tt> will return 0.0.
!!LATEX expressions useriface.tex
An expression is an algebraic combination of already defined vectors,
scalars (a scalar is a vector of length 1), constants, operators and
functions.  Some examples of expressions are:
\begin{quote}
{\vt cos(time) + db(v(3))}\\
{\vt sin(cos(log(10)))}\\
{\vt TIME*rnd(v(9)) - 15*cos(vin\#branch)\symbol{94}7.9e5}\\
{\vt not ((ac3.freq[32] \& tran1.time[10]) gt 3)}
\end{quote}

One should note that there are two math subsystems in {\WRspice}, the
vector system described here, and a second system for processing
equations found in device descriptions during simulation (see
\ref{devexpr}).  Although the expressions are syntactically similar,
there are important differences that must be taken into account, and
one should refer to the appropriate documentation for the type of
expression.

Vector expressions can also contain calls to the built-in ``tran''
functions ordinarily used in voltage/current source specifications in
transient analysis.  These are the {\vt pulse}, {\vt pwl}, etc. 
functions described in \ref{tranfuncs}.  If assigned to a vector, the
vector will have a length equal to the current scale (e.g., the time
values of the last transient analysis plot), and be filled in with
values just as if the analysis was run with the given source
specification.  For example
\begin{quote}
    (run transient analysis: tran .1n 10n)\\
    {\vt let a = pulse(0 1 1n 1n)}
\end{quote}
Vector {\vt a} will have length 101 and contain the pulse values.

There are three such functions, {\vt sin}, {\vt exp}, and {\vt
gauss}, that have the same names as math functions.  The math
functions always return data of the same length as the argument(s),
and take 1 argument for {\vt sin}, {\vt exp} and 2 for {\vt gauss}. 
When one of these names is encountered in an expression, {\WRspice}
counts the arguments.  If the number of arguments is 1 for {\vt
sin}/{\vt exp} or 1 or 2 for {\vt gauss}, the math function is called,
otherwise the tran function is called.  It may be necessary to give
the {\vt gauss} function a phony additional argument to force calling
the tran function.

\index{vector substitution}
Vectors can be evaluated by the shell parser by adding the prefix {\vt
\$\&} to the vector's name.  This is useful, for example, when the
value of a vector needs to be passed to the shell's {\cb echo}
command, or in circuit description files where vectors are to be
evaluated by the shell as the file is read.  Similar to the shell
constructs, {\vt \$?\&{\it word\/}} expands to 1 if {\it word\/} is a
defined vector, 0 otherwise.  Also {\vt \$\#\&{\it word\/}} expands to
the length of {\it word\/} if {\it word\/} is a defined vector, or 0
if not found.  Additionally, the notation {\vt \$\&({\it vector
expression\/})} is replaced by the value of the vector expression.  A
range specification can be added, for example {\vt echo \$\&(a+1)[2]}
prints the third entry in {\vt a+1}, or 0 if out of range.  If white
space exists in the {\vt \$\&(...)} construct, it probably should be
quoted.  Finally, the shell recognizes the construct {\vt \$\&v(\${\it
something\/})} as a reference to a SPICE node voltage, so that one can
index node voltages as {\vt echo \$\&v(\$\&i)}, for example.  A range
specification can be added, which can contain shell variables.  This
is true for both vectors ({\vt \$\&} prefix) and variables.

There is a special case when {\vt \$\&} is used with a special vector
(see \ref{specialvec}) that is referencing a string-type parameter. 
Since one can have
\begin{quote}\vt
.param foo="hello there"
\end{quote}
{\vt \$\&@foo} will expand to ``{\vt hello there}'' in this case. 
Other references to {\vt @foo} will return 0.0.

    Vectors may be indexed by
    <i>value</i>[<i>index</i>] or <i>value</i>[<i>low,high</i>].

    <p>
    The first notation refers to the <i>index</i>'th element of
    <i>value</i>.  The second notation refers to all of the elements
    of <i>value</i> which fall between the <i>high</i>'th and the
    <i>low</i>'th element, inclusive.  If <i>high</i> is less than
    <i>low</i>, the order of the elements in the result is reversed. 
    Note that a complex index will have the same effect as using the

    upper, since this is the way the parser reads this expression. 
    Multi-dimensional vectors are referenced as
    Vec[<i>ind</i>N][<i>ind</i>N-1]...[<i>ind</i>0], where each of the
    <i>ind</i>I can be a range, or single value.  The range must be
    within the vector's spanning space.  If fewer than the vector's
    dimensions are specified, the resulting object is a

The operations available in vector expressions are listed below.  They
all take two operands, except for unary minus and logical negation. 

\begin{description}
\item{{\bf addition operator}: {\vt $+$}}\\
Add the two operands.

\item{{\bf subtraction amd negation operator}: {\vt $-$}}\\
Evaluates to the first argument minus the second, and also may be used
as unary minus.

\item{{\bf multiply operator}: {\vt $*$}}\\
Multiply the two operands.

\item{{\bf divide operator}: {\vt $/$}}\\
The first operand divided by the second.

\item{{\bf modulo operator}: {\vt $\%$}}\\
This operates in the manner of the C {\vt fmod} function, returning
the remainder.  That is, for {\vt x$\%$y}, the value of {\vt
x$-$i$*$y} is returned for some integer {\vt i} such that the result
has the same sign of {\vt x} and magnitude less than the magnitude of
{\vt y}.  An error is indicated if {\vt y} is zero.  If {\vt x} or
{\vt y} is complex, the magnitudes are used in the division.

\item{{\bf power operator}: {\vt $\symbol{94}$} or {\vt $**$}}\\
Evaluates to the first operand raised to the power of the second.

\item{{\bf and operator}: {\vt $\&$} or {\vt $\&\&$} or {\vt and}}\\
Evaluates to 1 if both operands are non-zero, 0 otherwise.

\item{{\bf or operator}: {\vt $|$} or {\vt $||$} or {\vt or}}\\
Evaluates to 1 if either of the two operands is nonzero, 0 otherwise.

\item{{\bf not operator}: {\vt $\symbol{126}$} or {\vt !} or {\vt not}}\\
Evaluates to 1 if the operand is 0, 0 otherwise.

\item{{\bf greater-than operator}: {\vt $>$} or {\vt gt}}\\
Evaluates to 1 if the first operand is greater than the second, 0
otherwise.

\item{{\bf greater-than-or-equal operator}: {\vt $>=$} or {\vt ge}}\\
Evaluates to 1 if the first operand is greater than or equal to
the second, 0 otherwise.

\item{{\bf less-than operator}: {\vt $<$} or {\vt lt}}\\
Evaluates to 1 if the first argument is less than the second, 0
otherwise.

\item{{\bf less-than-or-equal operator}: {\vt $<=$} or {\vt le}}\\
Evaluates to 1 if the first argument is less than or equal to the
second, 0 otherwise.

\item{{\bf not-equal operator}: {\vt $<>$} or {\vt $!=$} or {\vt ne}}\\
Evaluates to 1 if the two operands are not equal, 0 otherwise.

\item{{\bf equal operator}: {\vt $=$} or {\vt $==$} or {\vt eq}}\\
Evaluates to 1 if both operands are equal, 0 otherwise.

\item{{\bf ternary conditional operator}:
      {\it expr} {\vt ?} {\it expr1} {\vt :} {\it expr2}}\\
If {\it expr} evaluates nonzeor (true), the result of the evaluation
of {\it expr1} is returned.  Otherwise, the result of evaluating
{\it expr2} is returned.  For Example:
\begin{quote}
\vt let v = (a == 2) ? v(1) : v(2)
\end{quote}
This will set {\vt v} to {\vt v(1)} if vector {\vt a} is equal to 2,
{\vt v} to {\vt v(2)} otherwise.

\item{{\bf comma operator}: {\vt ,}}\\
The notation {\it a\/},{\it b} refers to the complex number with real
part {\it a} and imaginary part {\it b}.  Such a construction may not
be used in the argument list to a macro function, however, since
commas are used to separate the arguments and parentheses may be
ignored.  The expression {\it a} + {\vt j}({\it b\/}) is equivalent. 
The comma does {\it not} behave as an operation (return a value) as it
does in C.
\end{description}

The logical operations are {\vt $\&$} (and), {\vt $|$} (or), {\vt
$\symbol{126}$} (not), and their synonyms.  A nonzero operand is
considered ``true''.  The relational operations are {\vt $<$}, {\vt
$>$}, {\vt $<=$}, {\vt $>=$}, {\vt $=$}, and {\vt $<>$} (not equal),
and their synonyms.  If used in an algebraic expression they work like
they would in C, producing values of 0 or 1.  The synonyms are useful
when {\vt <} and {\vt >} might be confused with IO redirection (which
is almost always).

\begin{description}
\item{\bf expression terminator}: {\vt ;}\\
The expression parser will terminate an expression at a semicolon. 
This can be used to enforce tokenization of expression lists, however
it will also terminate command parsing if surrounded by white space.
\end{description}

Vectors may be indexed by {\it value\/}[{\it index\/}] or {\it
value\/}[{\it low,high\/}].

The first notation refers to the {\it index\/}'th element of {\it
value}.  The second notation refers to all of the elements of {\it
value} which fall between the {\it high\/}'th and the {\it low\/}'th
element, inclusive.  If {\it high} is less than {\it low}, the order
of the elements in the result is reversed.  Note that a complex index
will have the same effect as using the real part for the lower value
and the imaginary part for the upper, since this is the way the parser
reads this expression.  Multi-dimensional vectors are referenced as
Vec[{\it ind\/}N][{\it ind\/}N-1]...[{\it ind\/}0], where each of the
{\it ind\/}I can be a range, or single value.  The range must be
within the vector's spanning space.  If fewer than the vector's
dimensions are specified, the resulting object is a sub-dimensional
vector.

Finally, there is the ran operator:  {\it value1\/}[[{\it value2\/}]]
or {\it value\/}[[{\it low,high\/}]].

The first notation refers to all the elements of {\it value1} for
which the element of the corresponding scale equals {\it value2}.  The
second notation refers to all of the elements of {\it value} for which
the corresponding elements of the scale fall between {\it high} and
{\it low}, inclusive.  If {\it high} is less than {\it low}, the order
of the elements in the result is reversed.

    There are a number of built-in math functions which take and
    return vectors.  Generally, these functions operate on the
    supplied vector term-by-term, returning a vector of the same
    length as that given.

    <p>
    The pre-defined functions available are listed below.  In general,
    all operations and functions will work on either real or complex
    values, providing complex data output when necessary.

    <p>
    In addition, there are statistical <a href="statfuncs">random
    number sources</a>, as well as <a href="measfuncs">measurement
    functions</a> exported by the <a href="measure"><b>measure</b></a>
    command, and a number of <a href="hs_functions">compatibility
    functions</a> to support <a href="hspicesim">HSPICE</a> extensions
    available.

    <p>
    It should be noted that the mathematics subsystem used to evaluate
    expressions in voltage/current <a href="src">sources</a> is
    completely different.  In that subsystem, functions take real
    valued scalars as input.  Although many of the same functions are
    available in both systems, the correspondence is not absolute.

    <a name="deriv"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>deriv function</b>: <tt>deriv</tt>(<i>vector</i>)<dd>
    This calculates the derivative of the given <i>vector</i>, using
    numeric differentiation by interpolating a polynomial.  However,
    it may be prone to numerical errors, particularly with iterated
    differentiation.  The implementation only calculates the
    derivative with respect to the real component of that vector's
    scale.  The polynomial degree used for differentiation can be
    specified with the <a href="dpolydegree"><tt>dpolydegree</tt></a>

    <dt><b>erfc function</b>: <tt>erfc</tt>(<i>vector</i>)<dd>
    Each point of the real returned vector is the complementary error
    function of the corresponding real point of <i>vector</i>.

    result.
    </dl>

    <a name="exp"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>exp function</b>: <tt>exp</tt>(<i>vector</i>)<dd>

    </dl>

    <a name="fft"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>fft function</b>: <tt>fft</tt>(<i>vector</i>)<dd>
    The <tt>fft</tt> function returns the Fourier transform of
    <i>vector</i>, using the present scale of <i>vector</i>.  The
    scale should be linear and monotonic.  The length is zero-padded
    to the next binary power.  Only the real values are considered in
    the transform, so that the negative frequency terms are the
    complex conjugates of the positive frequency terms.  The negative
    frequency terms are not included in the (complex) vector returned. 
    A scale for the returned vector is also generated and linked to
    the returned vector.
    </dl>

    <a name="floor"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>floor function</b>: <tt>floor</tt>(<i>vector</i>)<dd>
    This function returns the largest integer less than or equal to the
    argument, in the manner of the C function of the same name.  If
    the argument is complex, the operation is performed on both
    components, with the result being complex.  The operation is
    performed at each point of the argument.
    </dl>

    <a name="gamma"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>gamma function</b>: <tt>gamma</tt>(<i>vector</i>)<dd>
    This function returns the gamma value of the real argument (or the
    real part of a complex argument), returning real data.
    </dl>

    <a name="ifft"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>ifft function</b>: <tt>ifft</tt>(<i>vector</i>)<dd>
    The <tt>ifft</tt> function returns the inverse Fourier transform
    of <i>vector</i>, using the present scale of <i>vector</i>.  The
    scale should be linear and monotonically increasing, starting at 0. 
    Negative frequency terms are assumed to be complex conjugates of
    the positive frequency terms.  The length is zero-padded to the
    next binary power.  A scale for the returned vector is also
    generated and linked to the returned vector.  The returned vector
    is always real.
    </dl>

    <a name="im"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>im function</b>: <tt>im</tt>(<i>vector</i>)<dd>
    Each point of the real returned vector is the imaginary part of
    the corresponding point of the given <i>vector</i>.  This function
    can also be called as "<tt>imag</tt>".
    </dl>

    <a name="int"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>int function</b>: <tt>int</tt>(<i>vector</i>)<dd>
    The returned value is the nearest integer to the argument, in the
    manner of the C <tt>rint</tt> function.  If the argument is
    complex, the operation is performed on each component with the
    result being complex.  The operation is performed at each point in
    the argument.
    </dl>

    <a name="integ"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>integ function</b>: <tt>integ</tt>(<i>vector</i>)<dd>
    The return value is the (trapezoidal) integral of <i>vector</i>
    with respect to <i>vector</i>'s scale (which must exist).
    </dl>

    <a name="interpolate"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>interpolate function</b>: <tt>interpolate</tt>(<i>vector</i>)<dd>
    This function takes its data and interpolates it onto a grid which
    is determined by the default scale of the currently active plot. 
    The degree is determined by the <a
    href="polydegree"><tt>polydegree</tt></a> variable.  This is
    useful if the argument belongs to a plot which is not the current
    one.  Some restrictions are that the current scale, the
    <i>vector</i>'s scale, and the argument must be real, and that
    either both scales must be strictly increasing or strictly
    decreasing if they differ.

    <p>
    This function is used when operating on vectors from different
    plots, where the scale may differ.  For example, the x-increment
    may be different, or the points may correspond to internal time
    points from transient analysis rather than the user time points. 
    Without interpolation, operations are generally term-by-term,
    padding when necessary.  This result is probably not useful if
    the scales are different.

    <p>
    For example, the correct way to print the difference between a
    vector in the current plot and a vector from another plot with a
    different scale would be
    <blockquote>
    <tt>print v(2) - interpolate(tran2.v(2))</tt>
    </blockquote>
    </dl>

    <a name="j"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>j function</b>: <tt>j</tt>(<i>vector</i>)<dd>
    Each point of the returned vector is the corresponding point of
    <i>vector</i> multiplied by the square root of -1.
    </dl>

    <a name="j0"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>j0 function</b>: <tt>j0</tt>(<i>vector</i>)<dd>
    Each point of the real returned vector is the Bessel order 0
    function of the corresponding real point of <i>vector</i>.  Unlike
    most of the functions, this function operates only on the real
    part of a complex argument, and always returns a real valued
    result.
    </dl>

    <a name="j1"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>j1 function</b>: <tt>j1</tt>(<i>vector</i>)<dd>
    Each point of the real returned vector is the Bessel order 1
    function of the corresponding real point of <i>vector</i>.  Unlike
    most of the functions, this function operates only on the real
    part of a complex argument, and always returns a real valued
    result.
    </dl>

    <a name="jn"></a>
    <dl>
    <dt><b>jn function</b>: <tt>jn</tt>(<i>vector</i>)<dd>
    Each point of the real returned vector is the Bessel order
    <i>n</i> function of the corresponding real point of
    <i>vector</i>, with <i>n</i> the truncated integer value of the
    imaginary part of <i>vector</i>.

    <p>
    Recall that for most math function, comma argument separators
    are interpreted as the comma operator
    <blockquote>
    <tt>a,b = (a + j*b)</tt>
    </blockquote>
    which resolves to a single complex value.  Thus, since scalars are

!!LATEX mathfuncs spExpressions.hlp
There are a number of built-in math functions which take and return
vectors.  Generally, these functions operate on the supplied vector
term-by-term, returning a vector of the same length as that given.

The pre-defined functions available are listed below.  In general, all
operations and functions will work on either real or complex values,
providing complex data output when necessary.

In addition, there are statistical random number sources, as well as
measurement functions exported by the {\cb measure} command, and a
number of compatibility functions to support HSPICE extensions
available.  These are described in sections that follow.

It should be noted that the mathematics subsystem used to evaluate
expressions in voltage/current sources is completely different.  In
that subsystem, functions take real valued scalars as input.  Although
many of the same functions are available in both systems, the
correspondence is not absolute.

\newcommand{\zzfmt}[1]{{\vt #1({\it vector\/})}}
\newcommand{\zzfmtt}[1]{{\vt #1({\it vector\_x\/}, {\it vector\_y\/})}}

\begin{description}
\index{abs function}
\item{\zzfmt{abs}}\\
Each point of the returned vector is the absolute value of the
corresponding point of {\it vector\/}.  This is the same as the {\vt
mag} function.

\index{acos function}
\item{\zzfmt{acos}}\\
Each point of the returned vector is the arc-cosine of the
corresponding point of {\it vector\/}.  This and all trig functions
operate with radians unless the {\et units} variable is set to {\vt
degrees}.

\index{acosh function}
\item{\zzfmt{acosh}}\\
Each point of the returned vector is the arc-hyperbolic cosine of the
corresponding point of {\it vector\/}.  This and all trig functions
operate with radians unless the {\et units} variable is set to {\vt
degrees}.

\index{asin function}
\item{\zzfmt{asin}}\\
Each point of the returned vector is the arc-sine of the
corresponding point of {\it vector\/}.  This and all trig functions
operate with radians unless the {\et units} variable is set to {\vt
degrees}.

\index{asinh function}
\item{\zzfmt{asinh}}\\
Each point of the returned vector is the arc-hyperbolic sine of the
corresponding point of {\it vector\/}.  This and all trig functions
operate with radians unless the {\et units} variable is set to {\vt
degrees}.

\index{atan function}
\item{\zzfmt{atan}}\\
Each point of the returned vector is the arc-tangent of the
corresponding point of {\it vector\/}.  This and all trig functions
operate with radians unless the {\et units} variable is set to {\vt
degrees}.

\index{atanh function}
\item{\zzfmt{atanh}}\\
Each point of the returned vector is the arc-hyperbolic tangent of the
corresponding point of {\it vector\/}.  This and all trig functions
operate with radians unless the {\et units} variable is set to {\vt
degrees}.

\index{cbrt function}
\item{\zzfmt{cbrt}}\\
Each point of the returned vector is a cube root of the corresponding
point of {\it vector\/}.

\index{ceil function}
\item{\zzfmt{ceil}}\\
This function returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to the
argument, in the manner of the C function of the same name.  If the
argument is complex, the operation is performed on both components,
with the result being complex.  This operation is performed at each
point in the given {\it vector}.

\index{cos function}
\item{\zzfmt{cos}}\\
Each point of the returned vector is the cosine of the
corresponding point of {\it vector\/}.  This and all trig functions
operate with radians unless the {\et units} variable is set to {\vt
degrees}.

\index{cosh function}
\item{\zzfmt{cosh}}\\
Each point of the returned vector is the hyperbolic cosine of the
corresponding point of {\it vector\/}.  This and all trig functions
operate with radians unless the {\et units} variable is set to {\vt
degrees}.

\index{db function}
\item{\zzfmt{db}}\\
Each point of the returned vector is the decibel value ({\vt 20 *
log10(mag)}) of the corresponding point of {\it vector}.

\index{deriv function}
\index{dpolydegree variable}
\item{\zzfmt{deriv}}\\
This calculates the derivative of the given {\it vector}, using
numeric differentiation by interpolating a polynomial.  However, it
may be prone to numerical errors, particularly with iterated
differentiation.  The implementation only calculates the derivative
with respect to the real component of that vector's scale.  The
polynomial degree used for differentiation can be specified with the
{\et dpolydegree} variable.  If {\et dpolydegree} is unset, the value
taken is 2 (quadratic).  The valid range is 0--7.

\index{erf function}
\item{\zzfmt{erf}}\\
Each point of the real returned vector is the error function of the
corresponding real point of {\it vector}.  Unlike most of the
functions, this function operates only on the real part of a complex
argument, and always returns a real valued result.

\index{erfc function}
\item{\zzfmt{erfc}}\\
Each point of the real returned vector is the complementary error
function of the corresponding real point of {\it vector}.  Unlike most
of the functions, this function operates only on the real part of a
complex argument, and always returns a real valued result.

\index{exp function}
\item{\zzfmt{exp}}\\
Each point of the returned vector is the exponentiation ($e^x$)
of the corresponding point of {\it vector\/}.

\index{fft function}
\item{\zzfmt{fft}}\\
The {\vt fft} function returns the Fourier transform of {\it
vector\/}, using the present scale of {\it vector}.  The scale should
be linear and monotonic.  The length is zero-padded to the next binary
power.  Only the real values are considered in the transform, so that
the negative frequency terms are the complex conjugates of the
positive frequency terms.  The negative frequency terms are not
included in the (complex) vector returned.  A scale for the returned
vector is also generated and linked to the returned vector.

\index{floor function}
\item{\zzfmt{floor}}\\
This function returns the largest integer less than or equal to the
argument, in the manner of the C function of the same name.  If the
argument is complex, the operation is performed on both components,
with the result being complex.  The operation is performed at each
point of the argument.

\index{gamma function}
\item{\zzfmt{gamma}}\\
This function returns the gamma value of the real argument (or the
real part of a complex argument), returning real data.

\index{ifft function}
\item{\zzfmt{ifft}}\\
The {\vt ifft} function returns the inverse Fourier transform of {\it
vector\/}, using the present scale of {\it vector\/}.  The scale
should be linear and monotonically increasing, starting at 0. 
Negative frequency terms are assumed to be complex conjugates of the
positive frequency terms.  The length is zero-padded to the next
binary power.  A scale for the returned vector is also generated and
linked to the returned vector.  The returned vector is always real.

\index{im function}
\item{\zzfmt{im}}\\
Each point of the real returned vector is the imaginary part of the
corresponding point of the given {\it vector\/}.  This function can
also be calld as ``{\vt imag}''.

\index{int function}
\item{\zzfmt{int}}\\
The returned value is the nearest integer to the argument, in the
manner of the C {\vt rint} function.  If the argument is complex, the
operation is performed on each component with the result being
complex.  The operation is performed at each point in the argument.

\index{integ function}
\item{\zzfmt{integ}}\\
The returned vector is the (trapezoidal) integral of {\it vector}
with respect to the {\it vector\/}'s scale (which must exist).

\index{interpolate function}
\item{\zzfmt{interpolate}}\\
This function takes its data and interpolates it onto a grid which is
determined by the default scale of the currently active plot.  The
degree is determined by the {\et polydegree} variable.  This is useful
if the argument belongs to a plot which is not the current one.  Some
restrictions are that the current scale, the {\it vector\/}'s scale,
and the argument must be real, and that either both scales must be
strictly increasing or strictly decreasing if they differ.

This function is used when operating on vectors from different plots,
where the scale may differ.  For example, the x-increment may be
different, or the points may correspond to internal time points from
transient analysis rather than the user time points.  Without
interpolation, operations are generally term-by-term, padding when
necessary.  This result is probably not useful if the scales are
different.

For example, the correct way to print the difference between a vector
in the current plot and a vector from another plot with a different
scale would be
\begin{quote}
{\vt print v(2) - interpolate(tran2.v(2))}
\end{quote}

\index{j function}
\item{\zzfmt{j}}\\
Each point of the returned vector is the corresponding point of
{\it vector} multiplied by the square root of -1.

\index{j0 function}
\item{\zzfmt{j0}}\\
Each point of the real returned vector is the Bessel order 0 function
of the corresponding real point of {\it vector}.  Unlike most of the
functions, this function operates only on the real part of a complex
argument, and always returns a real valued result.

\index{j1 function}
\item{\zzfmt{j1}}\\
Each point of the real returned vector is the Bessel order 1 function
of the corresponding real point of {\it vector}.  Unlike most of the
functions, this function operates only on the real part of a complex
argument, and always returns a real valued result.

\index{jn function}
\item{\vt jn}({\it n\/}, {\it vector\/})\\
Each point of the real returned vector is the Bessel order {\it n}
function of the corresponding real point of {\it vector}, with {\it n}
the truncated integer value of the imaginary part of {\it vector}.

Recall that for most math function, comma argument separators
are interpreted as the comma operator
\begin{quote}
\vt a,b = (a + j*b)
\end{quote}
which resolves to a single complex value.  Thus, since scalars are
extended to vectors by replicating the value, on calling this function
as, for example, ``{\vt jn(v,3)}'' where {\vt v} is a real vector, the
return will be {\vt j3(v)} for each element of {\vt v}.

If {\it vector} is real, the effective value of {\it n} is 0.

\index{length function}
\item{\zzfmt{length}}\\
This function returns the scalar length of {\it vector\/}.

\index{ln function}
\item{\zzfmt{ln}}\\
Each point of the returned vector is the natural logarithm of the
corresponding point of {\it vector}.

\index{log function}
\item{\zzfmt{log}}\\
Each point of the returned vector is the base-10 logarithm of the
corresponding point of {\it vector}.

\index{log10 function}
\item{\zzfmt{log10}}\\
Each point of the returned vector is the natural logarithm of the
corresponding point of {\it vector} (same as {\vt ln}).

{\bf Warning:} in releases prior to 3.2.15, the {\vt log} function
returned the base-10 logarithm (as in Berkeley SPICE3).  This was
changed in 3.2.15 for compatibility with device simulation models
intended for HSPICE.

\index{mag function}
\item{\zzfmt{mag}}\\
Each point of the real returned vector is the magnitude of the
corresponding point of {\it vector}.

\index{mean function}
\item{\zzfmt{mean}}\\
This function returns the (scalar) mean value of the elements in
the argument.

\index{norm function}
\item{\zzfmt{norm}}\\
Each point of the returned vector is the corresponding point of the
given vector multiplied by the magnitude of the inverse of the largest
value in the given vector.  The returned vector is therefor normalized
to 1 (i.~e, the largest magnitude of any component will be 1).

\index{ph function}
\item{\zzfmt{ph}}\\
Each point of the real returned vector is the phase of the
corresponding point of {\it vector}, expressed in radians.

\index{pos function}
\item{\zzfmt{pos}}\\
This function returns a real vector which is 1 if the corresponding
element of the argument has a non-zero real part, and 0 otherwise.

\index{re function}
\item{\zzfmt{re}}\\
Each point of the real returned vector is the real part of the
corresponding point of {\it vector}.  The function can also be called
as ``{\vt real}''.

\index{rms function}
\item{\zzfmt{rms}}\\
This function integrates the magnitude-squared of {\it vector} over
the {\it vector\/}'s scale (using trapezoidal integration), divides by
the scale range, and returns the square root of this result.  If the
{\it vector} has no scale, the square root of the sum of the squares
of the elements is returned.

\index{sgn function}
\item{\zzfmt{sgn}}\\
Each value of the output vector is 1, 0, or -1 according to whether
the corresponding value of the input vector is larger than 0, equal to
zero, or less than 0.  The vector can be complex or real.

\index{sin function}
\item{\zzfmt{sin}}\\
Each point of the returned vector is the sine of the
corresponding point of {\it vector\/}.  This and all trig functions
operate with radians unless the {\et units} variable is set to {\vt
degrees}.

\index{sinh function}
\item{\zzfmt{sinh}}\\
Each point of the returned vector is the hyperbolic sine of the
corresponding point of {\it vector\/}.  This and all trig functions
operate with radians unless the {\et units} variable is set to {\vt
degrees}.

\index{sqrt function}
\item{\zzfmt{sqrt}}\\
Each point of the returned vector is the square root of the
corresponding point of {\it vector}.

\index{sum function}
\item{\zzfmt{sum}}\\
This function returns the (scalar) sum of the elements of {\it
vector}.

\index{tan function}
\item{\zzfmt{tan}}\\
Each point of the returned vector is the tangent of the
corresponding point of {\it vector\/}.  This and all trig functions
operate with radians unless the {\et units} variable is set to {\vt
degrees}.

\index{tanh function}
\item{\zzfmt{tanh}}\\
Each point of the returned vector is the hyperbolic tangent of the
corresponding point of {\it vector\/}.  This and all trig functions
operate with radians unless the {\et units} variable is set to {\vt
degrees}.

\index{unitvec function}
\item{\zzfmt{unitvec}}\\
This function returns a real vector consisting of all 1's, with length
equal to the magnitude of the first element of the argument.

\index{vector function}
\item{\zzfmt{vector}}\\
This function returns a vector consisting of the integers from 0 up to the
magnitude of the first element of its argument.

\index{y0 function}
\item{\zzfmt{y0}}\\
Each point of the real returned vector is the Neumann order 0 function
of the corresponding real point of {\it vector}.  Unlike most of the
functions, this function operates only on the real part of a complex
argument, and always returns a real valued result.

\index{y1 function}
\item{\zzfmt{y1}}\\
Each point of the real returned vector is the Neumann order 1 function
of the corresponding real point of {\it vector}.  Unlike most of the
functions, this function operates only on the real part of a complex
argument, and always returns a real valued result.

\index{yn function}
\item{\vt yn}({\it n\/}, {\it vector\/})\\
Each point of the real returned vector is the Neumann order {\it n}
function of the corresponding real point of {\it vector}, with {\it n}
the truncated integer value of the imaginary part.

Recall that for most math function, comma argument separators
are interpreted as the comma operator
\begin{quote}
\vt a,b = (a + j*b)
\end{quote}
which resolves to a single complex value.  Thus, since scalars are
extended to vectors by replicating the value, on calling this function
as, for example, ``{\vt yn(v,3)}'' where {\vt v} is a real vector, the
return will be {\vt y3(v)} for each element of {\vt v}.

If {\it vector} is real, the effective value of {\it n} is 0.

Statistical Functions
!!HTML 
    These functions generate random values, in accord with different
    statistical distribution properties.  Each relies on the
!!IFDEF WRspice
    <a href="seed"><b>seed</b></a>
!!ELSE
    <a href="wrs_seed"><b>seed</b></a>
!!ENDIF
    command to seed the internal random number generator which is
    common to all random sources.  Each distribution is defined by one
    or two parameters.  For distributions that take a single
    parameter, if passed a complex vector, the result will be a
    complex vector, using separately the distribution parameters in
    the real and imaginary parts.  For distributions that require two
    parameters, the return vector is always real, and the complex
    vector given will supply the two parameters as the real and
    imaginary parts.  If a real vector is given, a default value will
    be used for the second parameter.

    <p>
    Note that it is not likely that one would use different values for
    different indices of the given vector.  If all indices have the
    same value, then the return would contain a number of samples from
    the same distribution, which is what is almost always needed.

    <p>
    Perhaps most of the time the functions will be called with scalar
    values.  With these and other functions, bear in mind that the
    syntactic element expected as an argument is a "single" number,
    which can be real or complex.  When complex, it has the form
    "<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>" which looks like two numbers.  The take-away
    is that any of these functions can be called as
    <i>func</i>(<i>a</i>), or <i>func</i>(<i>a</i>, <i>b</i>) where
    <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are scalars.  The return depends on the
    function.

    <p>
    The user is expected to know the properties of these distributions
    and when to apply them.  There is much information about these
    distributions available on-line, and in Knuth.

!!LATEX statfuncs useriface.tex
These functions generate random values, in accord with different
statistical distribution properties.  Each relies on the {\cb seed}
command to seed the internal random number generator which is common
to all random sources.  Each distribution is defined by one or two
parameters.  For distributions that take a single parameter, if passed
a complex vector, the result will be a complex vector, using
separately the distribution parameters in the real and imaginary
parts.  For distributions that require two parameters, the return
vector is always real, and the complex vector given will supply the
two parameters as the real and imaginary parts.  If a real vector is
given, a default value will be used for the second parameter.

Note that it is not likely that one would use different values for
different indices of the given vector.  If all indices have the same
value, then the return would contain a number of samples from the same
distribution, which is what is almost always needed.

Perhaps most of the time the functions will be called with scalar
values.  With these and other functions, bear in mind that the
syntactic element expected as an argument is a ``single'' number,
which can be real or complex.  When complex, it has the form ``{\it
a\/}, {\it b\/}'' which looks like two numbers.  The take-away is that
any of these functions can be called as {\it func\/}({\it a\/}), or
{\it func\/}({\it a\/}, {\it b\/}) where {\it a} and {\it b} are
scalars.  The return depends on the function.

The user is expected to know the properties of these distributions and
when to apply them.  There is much information about these
distributions available on-line, and in Knuth.

\begin{description}
\index{beta function}
\item{\zzfmt{beta}}\\
The beta distribution is defined by two positive real values {\vt a}
and {\vt b}.  These are taken term by term as the real and imaginary
parts of {\it vector} when complex.  When real, the {\vt b} will use
the default value 1.0.

\index{binomial function}
\item{\zzfmt{binomial}}\\
The binomial distribution is defined by a positive real value {\vt p}
and positive integer {\vt n}.  These are taken term by term as the
real and imaginary parts of {\it vector} when complex.  The imaginary
value is truncated to form the integer.  When {\it vector} is real,
the {\vt n} will use the default value 1.

\index{chisq function}
\item{\zzfmt{chisq}}\\
The chi-square distribution is defined by a positive real
degrees-of-freedom value.  This is taken from {\it vector}
term-by-term.  If {\it vector} is real, the return is also real.  If
{\it vector} is complex, the return is also complex, with separate
results for the real and imaginary parts, obtained using the real and
imaginary parts of {\it vector}.

\index{erlang function}
\item{\zzfmt{erlang}}\\
The Erlang distribution is defined by two positive real values {\vt k}
and {\vt mean}.  These are taken term by term as the real and
imaginary parts of {\it vector} when complex.  When real, the {\vt
mean} will use the default value 10.0.  The return is a real vector of
the same length as {\it vector}.

\index{exponential function}
\item{\zzfmt{exponential}}\\
The exponential distribution is defined by a positive real mean value. 
This is taken from {\it vector} term-by-term.  If {\it vector} is
real, the return is also real.  If {\it vector} is complex, the return
is also complex, with separate results for the real and imaginary
parts, obtained using the real and imaginary parts of {\it vector}.

\index{ogauss function}
\item{\zzfmt{ogauss}}\\
This function returns a real vector which contains normally
distributed random values.  The standard deviation and mean are set by
the corresponding real and imaginary coefficients of {\it vector}
term-by-term, and the mean is zero if {\it vector} is real.

\index{poisson function}
\item{\zzfmt{poisson}}\\
The Poisson distribution is defined by a positive real mean value. 
This is taken from {\it vector} term-by-term.  If {\it vector} is

is also complex, with separate results for the real and imaginary
parts, obtained using the real and imaginary parts of {\it vector}.

\index{rnd function}
\item{\zzfmt{rnd}}\\
This function returns a vector which contains uniformly distributed
random values between 0 and the corresponding element of {\it
vector\/}.  If {\it vector} is complex then the return is also
complex, with the real and imaginary values within the range set by
the corresponding entries in {\it vector}.

\index{tdist function}

The student's T distribution is defined by a positive real
degrees-of-freedom value.  This is taken from {\it vector}

    Each function takes three arguments.  The first argument is a
    simulation result vector.  The second two arguments are scalar
    values of the vector's scale that define the measurement range
    (effectively the trigger and target points).  These are clipped to
    the actual vector scale if out of range.  The return value is
    a real scalar.

Compatibility Functions
!!HTML 
    These functions support compatibility with <a
    href="hspicesim">HSPICE</a>.

    <p>
    These functions differ from other <a href="mathfuncs">math
    functions</a> in that they take multiple comma-separated
    arguments, Other math functions internally accept a single
    argument, but if there are multiple comma-separated terms, they
    will be collapsed into a single argument through evaluation of the
    comma operator
    <blockquote>
        a,b = (a + j*b)
    </blockquote>
    which yields a complex value.  This will not be true in the
    functions listed below - the comma really means separate arguments
    in this case.

    <p>
    The first group of functions are equivalent to the HSPICE Monte
    Carlo functions that are called in <tt>.param</tt> lines in

The following functions are available, for compatibility with HSPICE.

These functions differ from other math functions in that they take
multiple comma-separated arguments, Other math functions
internally accept a single argument, but if there are multiple
comma-separated terms, they will be collapsed into a single
argument through evaluation of the comma operator
\begin{quote}
\vt a,b = (a + j*b)
\end{quote}
which yields a complex value.  This will not be true in the functions
listed below -- the comma really means separate arguments in this
case.

The first group of functions are equivalent to the HSPICE Monte Carlo
functions that are called in {\vt .param} lines in HSPICE.  In
{\WRspice}, these are regular math functions.

These functions will return mean values unless enabled.  They are
enabled while in Monte Carlo analysis, or if the {\et random} variable
is set, either from the command line or from a {\vt .options} line in
a circuit file.

\begin{description}
\index{unif function}
\item{\vt unif}({\it nom\/}, {\it rvar\/})\\
Uniform relative random value function.

This returns a vector the same length as {\it nom}, complex or real as
{\it nom}.  If the length of {\it rvar} is less than the length of
{\it nom}, {\it rvar} is extended by replicating the highest index
value of {\it rvar}.

If we are not running Monte Carlo analysis, and the {\et random}
variable is not set, the return vector is the same as {\it nom} (no
random values are generated).  Otherwise the return vector contains
uniformly distributed random values, each in the range [{\it nom} -
{\it nom\/}*{\it rvar\/}, {\it nom} + {\it nom\/}*{\it rvar\/}]
term-by-term.

Below, {\vt random} is a pseudo-function that returns a random number
between -1 and 1.

\begin{description}
\item{If {\it nom} is complex and {\it var} is complex:}\\
  {\vt out[i].real = nom[i].real*(1 + random()*rvar[i].real)}\\
  {\vt out[i].imag = nom[i].imag*(1 + random()*rvar[i].imag)}

\item{If {\it nom} is complex and {\it var} is real:}\\
  {\vt out[i].real = nom[i].real*(1 + random()*rvar[i])}\\
  {\vt out[i].imag = nom[i].imag*(1 + random()*rvar[i])}

\item{If {\it nom} is real and {\it var} is complex:}\\
  {\vt out[i] = nom[i].real*(1 + random()*rvar[i].real)}

\item{If {\it nom} is real and {\it var} is real:}\\
  {\vt out[i] = nom[i]*(1 + random()*rvar[i])}
\end{description}

\index{aunif function}
\item{\vt aunif}({\it nom\/}, {\it var\/})\\
Uniform absolute random value function.

This returns a vector the same length as {\it nom\/}, complex or real
as {\it nom\/}.  If the length of {\it var} is less than the length of
{\it nom\/}, {\it var} is extended by replicating the highest index
value of {\it var\/}.

If we are not running Monte Carlo analysis, and the {\et random}
variable is not set, the return vector is the same as {\it nom} (no
random values are generated).  Otherwise The return vector contains
uniformly distributed random values, each in the range [{\it nom} -
{\it var\/}, {\it nom} + {\it var\/}] term-by-term.

Below, {\vt random} is a pseudo-function that returns a random number
between -1 and 1.

\begin{description}
\item{If {\it nom} is complex and {\it var} is complex:}\\
  {\vt out[i].real = nom[i].real + random()*var[i].real}\\

\end{description}

\index{gauss function}
\item{\vt gauss}({\it nom\/}, {\it rvar\/},
  {\it sigma\/})\\
Gaussian relative random number generator.

This returns a vector the same length as {\it nom\/}, complex or real
as {\it nom\/}.  If the length of {\it rvar} is less than the length
of {\it nom\/}, {\it rvar} is extended by replicating the highest
index value of {\it rvar\/}.  Only the zero'th (real) component of
{\it sigma} is used.

If fewer than three arguments are given, this reverts to the original
{\WRspice} {\vt gauss} function (now called {\vt ogauss}).

If we are not running Monte Carlo analysis, and the {\et random}
variable is not set, the return vector is the same as {\it nom} (no
random values are generated).  Otherwise the return vector contains
gaussian-distributed random values.  The (scalar) {\it sigma} value
gives the specified sigma of the {\it rvar} data, generally 1 or 3.

Below, the pseudo-function {\vt gauss} returns a gaussian random
number with zero mean and unit standard deviation.

\begin{description}
\item{If {\it nom} is complex and {\it var} is complex:}\\
  {\vt out[i].real = nom[i].real*(1 + gauss()*rvar[i].real/sigma)}\\

as {\it nom\/}.  If the length of {\it var} is less than the length of
{\it nom\/}, {\it var} is extended by replicating the highest index
value of {\it var\/}.  Only the zero'th (real) component of {\it
sigma} is used.

If we are not running Monte Carlo analysis, and the {\et random}
variable is not set, the return vector is the same as {\it nom} (no
random values are generated).  Otherwise the return vector contains
gaussian-distributed random values.  The (scalar) {\it sigma} value
gives the specified sigma of the var data, generally 1 or 3.

number with zero mean and unit standard deviation.

Random limit function.

This returns a vector the same length as {\it nom\/}, complex or real
as {\it nom\/}.  If the length of {\it var} is less than the length of
{\it nom\/}, {\it var} is extended by replicating the highest index
value of {\it var\/}.

If we are not running Monte Carlo analysis, and the {\et random}
variable is not set, the return vector is the same as {\it nom} (no
random values are generated).  Otherwise the return vector contains
either {\it nom} + {\it var} or {\it nom} - {\it var} determined
randomly, term-by-term.

Expression Lists
!!HTML
    Some commands, such as <a href="print"><b>print</b></a> and <a
    href="plot"><b>plot</b></a>, take expression lists as arguments. 
    In the simplest form, an expression list is a space-separated list
    of vectors.  In the general form, an expression list is a sequence
    of expressions involving vectors.  The parsing is context
    dependent, i.e., white space does not necessarily terminate an
    expression.  This leads to ambiguities.  For example, the command
    <blockquote>
    <tt>plot v(2) -v(3)</tt>
    </blockquote>
    can be interpreted as two vectors, or as a single vector representing
    the difference.  <i>WRspice</i> will assume the latter.

    <p>
    There are several ways to ensure that the former interpretation prevails.
    Double quotes may be used to separate the tokens, but white space must
    precede the leading quote mark:
    <blockquote>
    <tt>plot v(2) "-v(3)"</tt>
    </blockquote>
    Parentheses can also be used to enforce precedence, with white space
    ahead of the opening paren, as:
    <blockquote>
    <tt>plot v(2) (-v(3))</tt>
    </blockquote>
    In addition, the expression termination character, a semicolon,
    can be used.  This must be hidden from the shell, for example
    with a backslash:
    <blockquote>
    <tt>plot v(2)\; -v(3)</tt>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    There are situations where the name of a vector is so strange that
    it can't be accessed in the usual way.  For example, if a
    list-type special variable is saved with the <a
    href="save"><b>save</b></a> command, the plot may contain a vector with a
    name like "<tt>@b1[ic,0]</tt>".  To access this vector, one can't
    simply type the name, since the name is an expression which will
    actually lead to an evaluation error.  One has to fool the
    expression parser into taking the name as a string.  This will
    happen if the name is not the lead in a token and the name is
    double quoted.  If the name is the leading part of a token, it
    should be backslash-double-double quoted.

    <p>
    To use the double quotes to enforce string interpretation, one
    should have, for example,
    <blockquote>
    <tt>plot v(2) \""@b1[ic,0]"\"</tt>
    </blockquote>
    The extra set of quotes is needed only if the string is at the start 
    of a token, thus 
    <blockquote>
    <tt>plot 2*"@b1[ic,0]"</tt>
    </blockquote>
    is ok.  This may be a bit confusing, but this feature is seldom
    used, and a bit of experimentation will illustrate the behavior.

    <p>
    These commands can accept the <i>plotname</i>.<i>vecname</i>
    notation, where either field may be the wildcard "<t>all</tt>". 
    If the plotname is <tt>all</tt>, matching vectors from all plots
    are specified, and if the vector name is <tt>all</tt>, all vectors
    in the specified plots are referenced.  The <tt>constants</tt>
    plot is never matched by a plot wildcard.  Note that you may not
    use binary operations on expressions involving wildcards - it is
    not obvious what "<tt>all + all</tt>" should denote, for instance.

There are situations where the name of a vector is so strange that it
can't be accessed in the usual way.  For example, if a list-type

    is entered, the value of <tt>a</tt> (obtained as <tt>$a</tt>) is
    the string "<tt>10*2</tt>" and <i>not</i> the integer 20.

    <p>
    Some internally used variables have boolean values, such as 
    <blockquote><tt>
         set unixcom
    </tt></blockquote>
    which if set causes certain modes or functions to be active.

    <p>
    Vectors, however, always have numeric values, and can be created
    with <a href="let"><b>let</b></a> and <a
    href="compose"><b>compose</b></a>, and deleted with <a
    href="unlet"><b>unlet</b></a>.  If one enters
    <blockquote>
         <tt>let a = 10*2</tt>, or more simply<br>
         <tt>a = 10*2</tt>
    </blockquote>
    The value of the vector <tt>a</tt> is 20.  Note that the "<tt>let</tt>"
    is generally optional when assigning vectors.

    <p>
    At the risk of adding confusion, it should be noted that in recent
    <i>WRspice</i> releases, the <b>set</b> command can also be used
    to assign values to vectors.  The syntax

    <blockquote>
      <tt>set &</tt><i>vector</i> <tt>=</tt> <i>value</i>
    </blockquote>

    is equivalent to

    <blockquote>
      <tt>let</tt> <i>vector</i> <tt>=</tt> <i>value</i>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
    Vectors can be set to shell variables, in which case they take on
    the interpreted numerical values.  For example,
    <blockquote><tt>
         set a=10*2<br>
         b = $a
    </tt></blockquote>
    would assign the string "<tt>10*2</tt>" to the shell variable
    <tt>a</tt>, but the vector <tt>b</tt> would contain the value 20.

    <p>
    The inputs to most commands are vectors, however some commands,
    such as <a href="echo"><b>echo</b></a> substitute for shell
    variables.
    For example,
    <blockquote><tt>
         set a = "foo"<br>
         set b = "bar"<br>
         echo $a$b
    </tt></blockquote>
    would print "<tt>foobar</tt>".

    <p>
    Shell variables are expanded by <b>echo</b>, and in <i>WRspice</i>
    input when sourced.  If the value of a vector is needed in shell
    expansion, then the special prefix "<tt>$&</tt>" should be added. 
    This tells the shell interpreter that the following symbol is a
    vector, to be replaced by its value.  For example,
    <blockquote><tt>
         let a = 2.0e-2<br>
         echo $&a
    </tt></blockquote>
    will print "<tt>2.00000e-2</tt>".  However
    <blockquote><tt>
         let a = 2.0e-2<br>
         echo $a
    </tt></blockquote>
    would give an error message (unless a is also a shell variable),
    and
    <blockquote><tt>
         let a = 2.0e-2<br>
         echo a
    </tt></blockquote>
    would print "<tt>a</tt>".

    <p>
    Double quotes will cause multiple tokens to be taken as one, for
    example
    <blockquote><tt>
         set a = "a string"
    </tt></blockquote>
    will set a accordingly, whereas
    <blockquote><tt>
         set a = a string
    </tt></blockquote>
    will set shell variable <tt>a</tt> to "<tt>a</tt>" and shell
    variable <tt>string</tt> to boolean true.

    <p>
    Single quotes do about the same thing, but suppress shell variable
    expansion.  For example:
    <blockquote><tt>
         set a = foo<br>
         set b = bar<br>
         echo $a $b
    </tt></blockquote>
    and
    <blockquote><tt>
         set a = foo<br>
         set b = bar<br>
         echo "$a $b"
    </tt></blockquote>
    would print "<tt>foo bar</tt>", whereas
    <blockquote><tt>
         set a = foo<br>
         set b = bar<br>
         echo '$a $b'
    </tt></blockquote>
    would print "<tt>$a $b</tt>".

    <p>
    In the present version, <tt>$</tt> can not be nested.  For example,
    <blockquote><tt>
         set a = foo<br>
         set b = bar<br>
         set c = '$a$b'<br>
         echo $c
    </tt></blockquote>
    prints "<tt>$a$b</tt>", not "<tt>foobar</tt>".  However,
    <blockquote><tt>
         set a = foo<br>
         set b = bar<br>
         set c = $a$b<br>
         echo $c
    </tt></blockquote>
    does print "<tt>foobar</tt>" (the value of <tt>c</tt>).

    <p>
    Shell variables that are lists are referenced with zero-based
    index, for example
    <blockquote><tt>
         set a = ( aa bb cc )<br>
         echo $a[1]
    </tt></blockquote>
    prints "<tt>bb</tt>".

    <p>
    Actually, what can be in the brackets is [<i>lo</i>-<i>hi</i>],
    where <i>lo</i> defaults to 0 and <i>hi</i> defaults to the length
    - 1.  If <i>lo</i> > <i>hi</i>, the list is reversed.

    If the reference is to a vector, as in
    <blockquote><tt>
         compose a values .1 .2 .3<br>
         echo $&a[1]
    </tt></blockquote>
    the index is also zero-based, so "<tt>2.0000e-1</tt>" is printed.

    <p>
    The [] subscripting is interpreted a little differently by the
    shell and by the vector parser.  If a variable starts with
    <tt>$</tt>, as in <tt>$&value[]</tt>, the <tt>[]</tt> is
    interpreted by the shell parser.  In this case, the terms inside
    <tt>[]</tt> must be interpreted as shell variables, with the
    (optional) <i>low</i>-<i>high</i> notation.  In a vector
    expression, i.e., one using <tt>value[]</tt>, the terms inside
    <tt>[]</tt> will be interpreted as vector expressions, with the
    optional <i>low</i><tt>,</tt><i>high</i> notation.  Thus,
    <blockquote><tt>
         if (value[index] = 0)
    </tt></blockquote>
    is perfectly legal for vectors <tt>value</tt> and <tt>index</tt>. 
    Also, equivalently,
    <blockquote><tt>
         if ($&value[$&index] = 0)
    </tt></blockquote>
    is also ok, though not as efficient.  However
    <blockquote><tt>
         if ($&value1[index] = 0)
    </tt></blockquote>
    is an error, as the shell parser does not know that <tt>index</tt>
    is a vector.

    <p>
    Shell variables can be used freely in vector expressions, however
    one must keep in mind how the variables are interpreted.  During
    parsing, the shell variables are evaluated, and their values put
    back into the expression as constants.  Then the expression is
    evaluated as a vector expression.

Novice {\WRspice} users may be confused by the different
interpretations of shell variables and vectors.  Any variable can be
defined with the {\cb set} command, and undefined with {\cb unset}. 
If defined, the value of the variable is the string, if given.  For
example, if
\begin{quote}\vt
set a = 10*2
\end{quote}
is entered, the value of {\vt a} (obtained as {\vt \$a}) is the string
``{\vt 10*2}'' and {\it not} the integer 20.

Some internally used variables have boolean values, such as 
\begin{quote}\vt
set unixcom
\end{quote}
which if set causes certain modes or functions to be active.

Vectors, however, always have numeric values, and can be created with
{\cb let} and {\cb compose}, and deleted with {\cb unlet}.  If one
enters
\begin{quote}\vt
let a = 10*2, {\rm or more simply}\\
a = 10*2
\end{quote}
the value of the vector {\vt a} is {\vt 20}.  Note that the ``{\vt let}''
is generally optional when assigning vectors.

At the risk of adding confusion, it should be noted that in recent
{\WRspice} releases, the {\cb set} command can also be used to assign
values to vectors.  The syntax

\begin{quote}
{\vt set \&}{\it vector} {\vt =} {\it value}
\end{quote}
 
is equivalent to
 
\begin{quote}
{\vt let} {\it vector} {\vt =} {\it value}
\end{quote}

Vectors can be set to shell variables, in which case they take on
the interpreted numerical values.  For example,
\begin{quote}\vt
set a=10*2\\
b = \$a
\end{quote}
would assign the string {\vt 10*2} to the shell variable {\vt a}, but the
vector {\vt b} would contain the value {\vt 20}.

The inputs to most commands are vectors, however some commands,
such as {\cb echo}, substitute for shell variables.  For example,
\begin{quote}\vt
set a = "foo"\\
set b = "bar"\\
echo \$a\$b
\end{quote}
would print ``{\vt foobar}''.

Shell variables are expanded by {\cb echo}, and in {\WRspice} input when
sourced.  If the value of a vector is needed in shell expansion,
then the special prefix {\vt \$\&} should be added.  This tells the
shell interpreter that the following symbol is a vector, to be
replaced by its value.  For example,
\begin{quote}\vt\rr
let a = 2.0e-2\\
echo \$\&a\\
\end{quote}
will print {\vt 2.00000e-2}.  However
\begin{quote}\vt\rr
let a = 2.0e-2\\
echo \$a\\
\end{quote}
would give an error message (unless {\vt a} is also a shell variable),
and
\begin{quote}\vt
let a = 2.0e-2\\
echo a
\end{quote}
would print ``{\vt a}''.

Double quotes will cause multiple tokens to be taken as one, for
example
\begin{quote}\vt
set a = "a string"
\end{quote}
will set {\vt a} accordingly, whereas
\begin{quote}\vt
set a = a string
\end{quote}
will set shell variable {\vt a} to ``{\vt a}'' and shell variable {\vt
string} to boolean true.

Single quotes do about the same thing, but suppress shell variable
expansion.  For example:
\begin{quote}\vt
set a = foo\\
set b = bar\\
echo \$a \$b
\end{quote}
and
\begin{quote}\vt
set a = foo\\
set b = bar\\
echo "\$a \$b"
\end{quote}
would print ``{\vt foo bar}'', whereas
\begin{quote}\vt
set a = foo\\
set b = bar\\
echo '\$a \$b'
\end{quote}
would print ``{\vt \$a \$b}''.

In the present version, {\vt \$} can not be nested.  For example,
\begin{quote}\vt
set a = foo\\
set b = bar\\
set c = '\$a\$b'\\
echo \$c
\end{quote}
prints ``{\vt \$a\$b}'', not ``{\vt foobar}''.  However,
\begin{quote}\vt
set a = foo\\
set b = bar\\
set c = \$a\$b\\
echo \$c
\end{quote}
does print ``{\vt foobar}'' (the value of {\vt c}).

Shell variables that are lists are referenced with zero-based index,
for example
\begin{quote}\vt
set a = ( aa bb cc )\\
echo \$a[1]
\end{quote}
prints ``{\vt bb}''.

Actually, what can be in the brackets is {\vt [{\it lo\/}-{\it hi\/}]},
where {\it lo\/} defaults to 0 and {\it hi\/} defaults to the length - 1. 
If {\it lo\/} $>$ {\it hi\/}, the list is reversed.

If the reference is to a vector, as in
\begin{quote}\vt
compose a values .1 .2 .3\\
echo \$\&a[1]
\end{quote}
the index is also zero-based, so ``{\vt 2.0000e-1}'' is printed.

The {\vt []} subscripting is interpreted a little differently by the
shell and by the vector parser.  If a variable starts with {\vt \$},
as in {\vt \$\&value[]}, the {\vt []} is interpreted by the shell
parser.  In this case, the terms inside {\vt []} must be interpreted
as shell variables, with the (optional) {\it low\/}-{\it high}
notation.  In a vector expression, i.~e.~, one using {\vt value[]},
the terms inside {\vt []} will be interpreted as vector expressions,
with the optional {\it low\/},{\it high} notation.  Thus,
\begin{quote}\vt
if (value[index] = 0)
\end{quote}
is perfectly legal for vectors {\vt value} and {\vt index}.  Also,
equivalently,
\begin{quote}\vt
if (\$\&value[\$\&index] = 0)
\end{quote}
is also ok, though not as efficient.  However
\begin{quote}\vt
if (\$\&value1[index] = 0)
\end{quote}
is an error, as the shell parser does not know that {\vt index} is a
vector.

Shell variables can be used freely in vector expressions, however
one must keep in mind how the variables are interpreted.  During
parsing, the shell variables are evaluated, and their values put
back into the expression as constants.  Then the expression is
evaluated as a vector expression.
