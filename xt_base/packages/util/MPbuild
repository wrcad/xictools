#### Apple OS X setup script
#
# Create the gtk2 libraries and applications for building xictools
# with gtk2 support.
#
# See README at the top of the xictools source tree for info.

# Procedure:

# Go to macports.org and download the installer source file.  This will
# have a name like "Macports-2.4.2.tar.gz".

# Set the numbers in the line below to match the macports source file
# that you have downloaded to the current directory.
mpbase=Macports-2.4.2

# With the downloaded file in the current directory, run this script. 
# Stand by to give your password, and respond to prompts when asked. 
# After answering 'y' to the long list of ports to install, you can
# take a break.  The script will take a long time, maybe hours, to
# complete, as it builds from source gtk2 and all dependent programs.
 
# Once complete, it will have installed everything into
#   /use/local/gtk2-bundle-x11  (standard x11 version)
#   /use/local/gtk2-bundle      (experimental native version)
# Whichever you have, add its bin subdirectory to your search path.
# You should then be able to build and run xictools and other programs
# that use the gtk2 user interface.
