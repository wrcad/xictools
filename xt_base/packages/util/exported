#! /bin/sh

# This script sets the package operating systems and programs exported
# to wrcad.com.  It also defines the host names of the machines used
# to build the listed operating system packages.  Each of the listed
# operating system names should have a corresponding entry after
# "hosts".  The hosts should be resolvable on the users local network.
#
# Of course, all of this requires customization to the user's site and
# needs.

# Usage:
# Print the list of operating system package names supported.
#   exported oses
# Print the list of programs exported as packages.
#   exported progs
# Print the build host for a given package name.  The <pkgname>
# is from the "exported oses" list.
#   exported host <pkgname>
# Print the package file extension for the given package name.
#   exported sfx <pkgname>
#
# The externally exported version of this script accepts
#   exported version <pkgname>
# to print the version number of the package.  In the source, the
# mkcurrent script outputs the text of this file with the "#VERSIONS"
# line replaced with code to export version numbers, this is the
# script exported to the web site.
